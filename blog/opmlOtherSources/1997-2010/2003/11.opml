I said that it was really important that we do so. I told Kevin, on the drive down to San Jose, that I feel we're at a turning point in the weblog world, either we're going to be like every other hierarchy that's ever been, with secret deals, lots of impediments to progress, eventual stagnation; or we're going to overcome that. I've been through this before, many times. The early days of the Apple II market held great promise, then the IBM PC, then the Mac, then the Web. And so it goes. Nothing ever seems to change. Either you're in or out, and if you're out, sometimes you can't even tell until it's too late. I don't want to be part of that. So if Sifry has competitors, I want them to know how to be compatible with me. Same if I have competitors. So what if it helps the other guy. There are worse things. Anyway, with that preamble, Dave and Kevin, check out the category element on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.scripting.com/cats/Technology/Formats%20and%20Protocols/RSS.xml&quot;&gt;this feed&lt;/a&gt;.

				<outline text="There may be another law here. It goes something like this. When you meet in private with someone else to talk about something other people are interested in, &lt;i&gt;we all lose.&lt;/i&gt; So, for example, if Pete should go to a private meeting where something relevant to Paul is discussed, and Paul doesn't know about it, Paul's knowledge can't be applied to the process. He may be off doing something that assumes it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; being done, and he may be wasting huge amounts of time, or may end up competing in an area he'd prefer to partner in. Now there's nothing that says you can't tell me something in confidence, I have to be able to accept that, but it's at the point of intersection, where we make Thing A work with Thing B, that open-ness is so important. That way a guy out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://bruiser.umaa.olemiss.edu/ato/seating/ous/lf.jpg&quot;&gt;left field&lt;/a&gt; can break through.

				<outline text="Travel is never going to be the same. I stayed in a deluxe hotel on the peninsula, in a plush room that has to rent for $300 a night. But I paid $65 a night. This is because I used a computer network to do my bidding. In the past I'd have to call eight hotels to get their rates, and none of them would know that I was talking to any others, so I'd just get their average price. Or call a travel agent, and get directed to the hotel that gives them the best commission, not necessarily the best located hotel, or the one with the best deal for me. Now I can get multiple bids on the same hotel, even, and consider hundreds of options before making my decision. When people say the Internet wasn't revolutionary, they must not be paying attention. It gave us the power, where the industry used to have it. The power of better information, and that can translate into nicer accomodations for much less money.

And of course while the title says it's about beauty in women, it's really about beauty in general. We have so much in common. We all feel unappreciated, and left out. No one likes being talked-down-to by others, but it's especially humilating when a member of the opposite sex does it. Women have so much more power today than they did in the past, but do they use it wisely? We're getting close to the end of a year, which means we're getting close to a new year. When we flip the page, let's try to create more win-wins and not be so picky about who we get help from. If someone offers a hand in friendship, try to take it, even if it isn't exactly the person you wanted it from, or on exactly the terms you wanted it.

This is great news of course. We're going to connect our weblog networks in some really interesting ways, I hope.

At dinner last night I sat next to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/chinadn/en/&quot;&gt;Xiao Qiang&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow at UC-Berkeley's school of journalism, and suggested we do the same with their student weblogs. I would make the same offer to Jay Rosen at NYU. Let's link up our networks of bloggers. I told Xiao this is beginning to sound like the way the Internet itself started. Is a new network booting up, one built on ideas as much as technology? One where users are the architects. It could be that the university environment, with these new bright-eyed leaders, is the perfect petrie dish for new Internet culture. " created="Wed, 26 Nov 2003 13:32:51 GMT" type="outline"/>

I talked for about twenty minutes, and then we had a discussion. They asked tough questions, one of which I declined to answer, but on reflection, I could have. I had said that lack-of-&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/ruleOfWinwin&quot;&gt;reciprocation&lt;/a&gt; is common in the weblog world, but rarely talked about. Person A delivers flow to Person B, but B doesn't point to A. I was asked for an example, but declined. I didn't want to take any specific person to task on this, my point would have been lost. But I could have talked about a class of websites that receive lots of pointers and rarely point back -- newspaper sites. Anyway, thanks to Larry and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blogs/gelman/&quot;&gt;Lauren Gelman&lt;/a&gt; for inviting me to speak, and to Stuart Rosenberg for arranging.

They had a nice movie, which I didn't watch because I was reading an even better book. The guy next to me was a Silicon Valley entrepreneur from Taiwan whose company makes thin clients. Interesting stories. But when I got to SFO the car rental company, Thrifty, said I was a no-show and they had given my car to someone else. And they were sold out. So tired. I just stood there at the counter and said I wasn't leaving until they gave me a car. They gave me one. Drove down the peninsula and my hotel room is great. So it's been a yin-yang trip.

Eventually it will be released broadly and we'll work with others to make authoring tools in other environments (such as OmniOutliner, Joe, Flash, WebOutliner) and back-ends (lots of places). On the back-end if you have code that processes RSS (with categories) and OPML, you're basically ready to go. We're gearing up to cover a big story and to be ready to cover one that may come along any day. The idea is to broaden the pipe, make writing for the Web more powerful and make the structures we build richer, have more lasting value, and integrate with each other in interesting ways.

They're in rapid learning mode, talking to as many people as possible. I'm going to spend a lot of time with them next week transferring as much as possible of what I know about the product, the users, the potential. A few of them are going to the meeting tomorrow, including Jake. If I go, people may get the wrong idea. I want to help the new team, I don't want to steal their thunder. I want you all to learn how to work with each other, and the best way for me to do that is to step back and let it happen. So I send these very excellent people to you with much love.

The book came up in conversation because it offers a reasonable and highly optimistic view of existence. No one is actually dead, they're just reliving the important moments of their lives, maybe the not-so-important ones too. A philosophy that suggests that you should pack life with lots of interesting moments because you're going to be experiencing them for eternity. In this view, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=deja%20vu&quot;&gt;deja vu&lt;/a&gt; is a little leakage in the matrix (as it is in The Matrix)." category="/Fun/Books" created="Thu, 20 Nov 2003 12:18:59 GMT" type="outline"/>

I didn't mean, as some thought, to keep it free of the reporters employed by the media companies, I'm not worried about that. I &lt;i&gt;am&lt;/i&gt; worried about devices like The Broadcast Flag and other proposals (remember Berman-Coble) that would give the entertainment industry the power to shackle the computers, and invade the privacy of computer users (even remove data from our computers). Now it may be hopeless, as both Lessig and Rosen have observed, and so what? My job isn't to figure out which of the lesser of two evils to vote for. It's still so early in the process, now it's time to identify the important issues, and then ask any of the candidates if they want my vote. They may all say no, this time. But I'm demonstrating how the electoral process will work after we've flipped it around. If you're reasonably young and healthy I believe you will live to see the day.

I still review it in my mind every day, all the special moments, all the cool people who came. Charlie Nesson's convocation, the essential Harvard man, welcomed everyone with such love and enthusiasm. People don't know this about Harvard, but it can be a very very kind place, despite its reputation for great history and great achievement. I introduced some of my favorites -- Cluetrain author David Weinberger, my brother Peter Winer, Craig Cline from Seybold, the great designer Bryan Bell. I was so proud to welcome these people, esp my brother because our family has been through so much in the last year. Someone I didn't know before BloggerCon is &lt;a href=&quot;http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/&quot;&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;. His contribution is still bearing fruit. Every time I read a Rosen piece I'm cheering, yes yes, that's right, keep going. And there was a guy who came from Germany, who found out about the conference only two days before it happened, and he was consistently the jolliest fellow. He seemed truly delighted to learn about blogs, and to be at the Con. Well, today he sent a &lt;a href=&quot;http://simplyliveanywhere.com/home/communication/2003/11/18.html/1&quot;&gt;pointer&lt;/a&gt; to his new weblog, and it's as positive and cheerful as the man himself (whose name I don't know)." created="Wed, 19 Nov 2003 16:32:48 GMT" type="outline"/>

A perfect case in point is the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idealliance.org/news-summit/&quot;&gt;summit&lt;/a&gt; for news and XML. Where are the publishers and tech companies who use RSS 0.91 and 2.0. This, by most estimates, is over 75 percent of the market. Make-believe summitry. &quot;In the world as we wish it looked this is who would be at a summit.&quot; There have been technology summits where not a single delegate was an active programmer. The word has been abused to the point where it's meaningless. It's time, in the technology business, for people to start setting realisitc expectations. Nothing is going to instantly change the world. A summit that's exclusive is not a summit. Open minds, open meetings, that's the way to go." created="Wed, 19 Nov 2003 16:56:12 GMT" type="outline"/>

This hierarchy has to &lt;i&gt;contain&lt;/i&gt; Scripting, but of course it's at the top level of a domain. How do you get that to work? It took some baling wire to make it fit in. I fought for just &lt;i&gt;one piece&lt;/i&gt; of baling wire, not 100. So far so good. Next time I work on the hierarchy I will be able to use the outliner, which was the whole point.

On this rebuild they should make sense, they still won't go anywhere, but now I see how the URLs for the directory structure have to work. See what's going on?

Stewart was fiercely competitive. Everything about his conference was a response to Esther. He upped her, zigged where she zagged, in every way compared his show to hers. I found it fascinating because there clearly was room for a new conference, but I was good friends with both, and brainstormed with Stewart, seeing it as playfulness, not meanness. Now the cool thing about the competition was that they went to each others' conference, and seemed to genuinely be having a good time. I guess there's nothing like going to a conference that's a lot like your own, where &lt;i&gt;you don't have to work.&lt;/i&gt; I mention this because now I have graduated to being a conference-giver myself. With BloggerCon version 1.0 under my belt I now go to conferences with a new eye, looking for ideas that I can use or adapt in my next show. It's in my blood, changes the way I think. And I remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/ruleOfWinwin&quot;&gt;how well&lt;/a&gt; both Stewart and Esther competed, how they made me, a person who went to both their conferences, feel. Neither &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; tried to get us not to go to the other. Probably the most important symbol of this was that both were welcome at the other's conference. Bravo.

It was like a little outpost on the prairie, nothing but Big Sky and you could see light between the slats in the roof. No one would have complained about it being work-safe back then because (almost) &lt;i&gt;no one was reading it.&lt;/i&gt; Now the prairie is a bustling metropolis, and my little house is on a block with shopping centers, schools, porn shops, you name it.

In a few hours I'll have a way to look at all the items on a per-category basis. I've been pretty good so far about assigning categories to blog posts here. For example, the Fleshbot post below is routed to Fun/Sex. This one is routed to Dave/Scripting News and Technology/Formats and Protocols/RSS.

Also, to clear up some confusion, UserLand has had category support in Manila and Radio for years. This is the first time categories have been used in this weblog, and they're hierarchic, not flat. That &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a first, as far as I know. When you see how the hierarchy works, you're going to want it. At least that's my evil plan. &quot;;-&gt;&quot;" category="/Dave/Scripting News,/Technology/Formats and Protocols/RSS" created="11/10/2003; 4:07:50 AM" type="outline"/>

Part of the puzzle is finished. The items in the RSS feed for this weblog can be routed to categories. Now to the back-end. As the page is published, we watch for items with categories, and route them to the appropriate place. So if you want to get caught up on all the news from the Edwards campaign, there will be a place for that. Now of course a grad student could be working specifically on news of Edwards, maybe even on the press bus with Edwards. Maybe two grad students. Maybe thirty-two. And maybe the student who's working on Boston weather comes across something relevant to Edwards-watchers. This shouldn't be a problem. I told my friend Adam Curry in an email, the idea is that I can write for 100 weblogs, and 100 people can write for a specific weblog. We can get the overhead very low. This is how we're going to scale up to cover the 2004 election. It's a moon mission. Each user will get some new software and an assignment. It'll be a project like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/twentyFour/&quot;&gt;24 Hours of Democracy&lt;/a&gt; in 1996, a demo of neat net tricks and a way for people with weblog skills to make a difference. And of course if an event like 9/11 comes along, we'll be that much better prepared to cover it. " created="Sun, 09 Nov 2003 17:14:33 GMT" type="outline"/>

Dean has to watch out for that. He's got a big target painted on his back. Also, they say that Dean actually already has made his mind up about campaign finance, and that the poll of his supporters is certain to return the result he wants. But the interviewer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/alum/refresher/bio_harris.html&quot;&gt;Gail Harris&lt;/a&gt;, missed the obvious question -- what is the predetermined result?

I love it when somone reaches inside the balloon and pulls it out by the inside and the problem gets simpler.

No users talking about how much more powerful music is on the Internet. Just an industry victimized. And much worse, &lt;i&gt;no disclaimer&lt;/i&gt; from 60 Minutes that they work for a major &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viacom.com/&quot;&gt;media company&lt;/a&gt; with a huge stake in the outcome.

It's still a nice design. And the docs are still scattered all over the world. At least there's Google now, which does a good job of indexing. I'm going slowly making sure that the environment I'm creating has many of the bells and whistles I've missed in previous ones. For example, today I'm making it so that every day in the archive of Scripting News automatically has an RSS rendering. And I'm doing a month-at-a-glance page, before I get to the real meaty project, a right-click menu that lets me route any item to any number of places. I'm thinking about what a power info maven really wants in 2004, not what he or she is willing to settle for. People like Jenny Levine, Steve Gillmor, Charlie Nesson, Jeremy Allaire, Joe Trippi, Jay Rosen. And of course myself. I try to visualize a Content Router and Idea Processor combined with the World Wide Web. Meanwhile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grumet.net/weblog/&quot;&gt;Andrew Grumet&lt;/a&gt; is climbing another facet of the same hill, smoothing out the connection between outlining and non-UserLand weblog managers. Choice is super-important, as we all know. Even if they don't include us in their plans, we must include them in ours, to keep the door open for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggerCon/ruleOfWinwin&quot;&gt;win-win&lt;/a&gt;.

In open source politics, a term which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.com/news/934298.asp&quot;&gt;Joe Trippi&lt;/a&gt; uses to describe the Dean campaign, could I take a snapshot of their codebase (borrow the candidate) and fork the project?
