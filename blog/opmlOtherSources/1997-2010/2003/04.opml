					<outline text="Today at Berkman we got a presentation on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prx.org/&quot;&gt;PRX&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for Public Radio eXchange. It's a B2B marketplace connecting producers of public radio shows to radio stations, alongside NPR and PRI. It's not for you and me, an ordinary person can't access the content in the PRX database, unless we're one of their reviewers. There's a fatal flaw, imho -- the producers of the content don't insist on getting paid, and the users of the content don't want to pay. Yet their business depends on money flowing between the two. They say the alternative is an MP3.Com type arrangement, which of course isn't attractive because it was based on dotcom money from the public market and you can't get that kind of money anymore, and was ultimately taken out by an RIAA lawsuit.

Lots of talk about NH weblogs, and I passed around an idea I've been circulating via email (up till now) -- drafting &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/&quot;&gt;Philip Greenspun&lt;/a&gt; to run for President of the United States. As I was reading his blog this morning the thought hit me -- I'd vote for him -- in a second. I'd even work for him. I don't agree with all of his ideas, some of them are downright wacky (and probably illegal) but he gets you thinking. What's he got to lose? He's over 35, and I guess he's Jewish, but then so is Joe Lieberman. I mentioned this to Chris, he says he knows Lieberman (of course), but he really liked the idea of Greenspun running. Meanwhile &lt;a href=&quot;http://betsydevine.weblogger.com/2003/04/24#a132&quot;&gt;Betsy Devine&lt;/a&gt; is organizing support for Howard Dean. I said to Chris I want to have a real election next time around. He looked at me, and in his British-American way said &quot;There's the slogan.&quot; I guess that's it.

He said he had an idea for an innovation in aggregators. It took me a while to get it because it was a key feature of Radio's aggregator, it was also a key feature in My.UserLand, going back to 1999. That's when it hit me, most of the guys who are copying us aren't doing it right. Oy. RSS readers that work like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcorps.org/webteacher/winexp/newsgroups/open-screen2S.gif&quot;&gt;Usenet readers&lt;/a&gt; are a waste of time, imho.

Could it be that we have underestimated the difficulty of building a tool with which ordinary people can easily and simply create XML content?&quot; That tool is impossible, because writers generally are not programmers, and don't think or write with metadata, even simple title-link-description two-level hierarchies like RSS. The closest thing to an XML editor that's widely deployed and popular are weblog editors like Radio, Blogger and Manila. Coming in second are outliners that support OPML.

				<outline text="Next set of features for Manila -- optional human-authored summaries for long weblog posts, along with the option, on a per-post basis to include the summary or the full text in the RSS feed. This is the solution for the conundrum that's been circulating in RSS-Land: should feeds include the full posts, or summaries? The answer is to let the author make the decision, and it's not a global, it's made on a per-post basis. The default is full text so people who do short posts never have to think about it. Along with this we'll have both sides of Trackback. We're &lt;a href=&quot;http://static3.userland.com/mtweblog/&quot;&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt; with Moveable Type, but both sides will work without MT.

I'm getting accolades for the elegance in design. All I did was write the code (it wasn't simple, but it was straightforward). Going back to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/18#When:4:01:26AM&quot;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; about designers and programmers working together in 2003. A few flamers saw it as an anti-CSS rant. Oy they need to brush up on their reading skills. The words were clear. &quot;I think of designers as people who make me look good, not as political advisors.&quot; The basis for programmers and designers working together -- they make me look good. I'll put your ideas in motion. Win-win. A lot of designers miss something important, or forget it -- we're not designers, we don't think like you. I asked Bryan to put together a clear list of do's and don'ts so I don't make him mad. I like working with him, and want to continue to. " created="Tue, 22 Apr 2003 12:18:55 GMT"/>

				<outline text="Interesting timing, I'm did an OPML project this morning. Here's the problem. Before our server was up and running I started a directory for Harvard weblogs, we got 35 submissions, all from sites running off the Harvard network. Then the server went live, and we are starting new sites at an increasing rate, over 100 so far. Of couse those people wanted to know why they aren't in the directory. Oy. Last night I figured out how to put both directories together, without having to manually add each site as it comes online. I wrote a script that generates an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/berkman/sites.opml&quot;&gt;OPML document&lt;/a&gt; listing all the sites that have ten or more messages in the discussion group, indicating someone is posting stuff, either to the home page or as comments. Then I included that as a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/directory/36/harvardWeblogs/harvardhostedWeblogs&quot;&gt;sub-directory&lt;/a&gt;, and moved the off-site blogs into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/directory/36/harvardWeblogs/offsitehostedWeblogs&quot;&gt;sub-directory&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the two in the original location.

After a bit of chitchat the conversation swung around to the relationship we each had with Microsoft in the late 90s, and how we had been played off against each other by competing factions inside MS. He was promoting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macromedia.com/v1/handlers/index.cfm?id=5622&amp;method=full&quot;&gt;WDDX&lt;/a&gt; as the glue to connect Internet apps, and I was promoting SOAP (albeit a simpler form of SOAP than the one in use today). I remembered, anew, how much I respected him then, in the way you respect a worthy competitor. There was a moment when the pendulum had swung so far in favor of WDDX that my rabbi called me up to Redmond to tell me it looked like we had lost. Eventually SOAP did win, and Allaire and company got behind it, as I would have gotten behind WDDX had the MS chosen &lt;i&gt;it.&lt;/i&gt; Anyway, true to form, this afternoon Jeremy had a brilliant idea. One so damned simple and so do-able, and closes a loop that's existed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML&quot;&gt;years&lt;/a&gt;. I don't want to spoil the fun by leaking what it is, but when you hear it, you will slap your hand on your forehead, as I did, wondering why you didn't think of it.

					<outline text="My first impulse is to say who could possibly know, but then on further thought, I looked back instead of forward to see what 15 years had done to graphic personal computers, which were about where weblogs are today. The first commercal GPC had come out in 1984. By 1998 the form was pretty well set. How different is Windows XP from the Macintosh of 1988? Not very. It's faster and bigger, but basically does the same thing, in much the same way." created="Thu, 17 Apr 2003 10:48:51 GMT"/>
					<outline text="But on the other hand, the use of GPCs has grown enormously in 15 years. In 1988 you had to be a very special person to use a Mac. They were popular with people who did design and layout and people who think for a living. But now, people in all walks of life have a Windows or Mac PC (mostly Windows).

					<outline text="Weblogs are just part of the evolution of personal computers. Over time our expectation for information has risen. The late 80s were the end of the age of information poverty. Today we can look back and laugh at how inaccessible information was way back then. I did an experiment one evening after dinner, probably in 1989 or 1990. I wanted to find out the score in the Mets baseball game. I called the local radio station in San Francisco, they didn't know. I called a New York radio station, they didn't know. I called the NY Times, no idea. I called a radio station in San Diego where the game was being played, they didn't know either. That was a little more than ten years ago.

It's still the way of the future, imho. There's no single root of the Web, so why should directories (like Yahoo, DMOZ, Looksmart) have single roots?

So why not also have it available in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opml.org/&quot;&gt;format&lt;/a&gt; that allows it to be included in other directories? I should be able to include it in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/directory/167&quot;&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; I keep for RSS developers. Why should I have to reinvent the wheel? Would he want me to? And maybe it fits into a directory of tools that are useful for librarians, alongside book inventory software; or in a directory for lawyers, alongside legal databases. See the point? There is no single address for a directory, every directory is a sub-directory of something, yet all the directories we build on the Internet try to put everything in exactly one place, which leads to some really ludicrous placements. My Windows software is categorized under Mac software because we were only available on Mac when it was first categorized.

Technically there's no doubt that Eason Jordan has admitted a major breach of editorial integrity at CNN. CNN withheld a major conflict of interest, the Iraqi government was torturing and killing their employees and their families. We are told that this did change what they reported. It's understandable that they didn't disclose, but it's probably &lt;i&gt;not okay.&lt;/i&gt; It immediately raises the question of what other information is CNN withholding that might color their coverage of news in Iraq and elsewhere. The second disturbing angle on this piece is its historic value that will soon disappear behind the NY Times archive firewall. What was their expense in creating this important bit of editorial? It wasn't written by an employee of the New York Times Company. Sure they probably edited it. That cost something. And someone had to prepare it for their content management system. It's using a little bit of bandwidth. But what a cost, to not have this piece available for everyone to refer to, to re-read and re-consider, over the years. It could save lives. It could serve as an example of how not to do it. It's something every journalism student should study, everywhere, forever. Something to think about." created="Fri, 11 Apr 2003 11:22:00 GMT"/>

I've been asked to comment. Press releases are okay if they are clearly labeled as such. It's predictable that professional reporters would object to this practice, but they have a conflict of interest, which they don't disclose. The maker-of-news has a valuable perspective. That's the thesis of weblogs. Most press releases aren't worth reading. But they don't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be.
