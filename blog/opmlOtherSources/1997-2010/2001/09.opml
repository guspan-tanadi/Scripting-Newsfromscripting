The Seybold &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.key3media.com/seyboldseminars/sf2001/attendee/top_webpanel.shtml&quot;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt; of the session on Wednesday suggested that amateurs have less integrity than the pros. I think it's provable that this is not true. But let's not go there. That's fear. Let's find ways to get the information flowing to and from places where it doesn't. Let's draw an accurate picture of the world, and expose places where inaccurate pictures are being drawn. That should be our common goal -- amateurs and pros, working together." created="Fri, 28 Sep 2001 14:14:50 GMT"/>

I released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/09/10/openSourceIn2001&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on open source in 2001 that I had spent a couple of weeks preparing.

Good worldwide communication is as important as universal suffrage. However, we don't need to push our fantasies on cultures who may not have much experience to understand that Baywatch, Who Wants to be a Millionaire and CNN are not the west as it really is.

There are hundreds and hundreds of people in the lines, but everyone is very calm, tearful eyes, everybody, a lot of talking among people of just how sad things are. Everyone has cellphones.

The flight attendants talk about people they knew who died. Obviously the DC airport is open (NPR is reporting otherwise) and quiet. Dave's journey continues, cellphones are great.

Yesterday would it have made no sense to run a survey to ask if we are at war. Yesterday was a normal day. Today started normally too.

Not only can weblog items contain more than one link per item (like this item), they can also reasonably contain markup. It's a written medium. In writing sometimes you want to italicize for emphasis, or to add a new voice, there are even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaanet.org/aa/styleguide.htm&quot;&gt;formal rules&lt;/a&gt; that some publications follow to the letter. Further, many weblog items don't have an easily discernable title. RSS defines a rigid publication style, weblogs are less formal. Anyway, it's great to see the community get past the respect issues. I'm not sure where it's going, but the most important thing is that people are addressing each other as adults. With that, problems can be solved, and perhaps new formats and services designed and deployed.

					<outline text="I get to roll out a fun new Manila feature today. Like the ogre named Shrek it comes in layers like an onion. It's just a macro you put in the template for your site, but it gives your readers an important tool to spread news from your site. All the big sites have the feature, but this is the first time (as far as I know) that it's available for ordinary folk like you and me and it's pretty easy. "/>
					<outline text="First the demo. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2001/08/31/microsoftsScriptingStrategy&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; on the DaveNet site, and scroll to the bottom. You'll &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/mailStory3.gif&quot;&gt;see&lt;/a&gt; a link called Mail This Story. Click on it. Enter your email address, a brief personal message, and enter your email address again. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/mailThisStory2.gif&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt; on Submit. Check your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/mailStoryScreen1.gif&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. "/>
					<outline text="The story is sent in plain text not HTML (we can do this because Manila is a content management system, we get the story out of the database, not by scraping the screen as others do). Links are extracted from anchor tags and replaced with numbers in square brackets. All the links appear at the end of the email. Bold text is surrounded in asterisks and italic text enclosed in slashes. Markup is removed. Breaks and paragraphs are converted to single and double carriage returns. Other whitespace is converted. We use the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://docserver.userland.com/string/htmlToEmail&quot;&gt;string.htmlToEmail&lt;/a&gt; verb to do the transformations on the story text."/>
					<outline text="Now the docs. To add this feature to your UserLand-hosted Manila site, add a macro to your template, generally right after the \{bodytext} macro is a good place to put it. The macro is \{mailStory ()}. It takes an optional parameter that determines the link text. It can be an image if you prefer images over text. The link will only appear on stories and discussion group messages. On other pages the macro returns the empty string. This is the only configuration that's needed to add the feature to a Manila site."/>

					<outline text="Questions and comments on the Manila-Newbies &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.userland.com/mailman/listinfo/manila-newbies&quot;&gt;mail list&lt;/a&gt;."/>
					<outline text="Tweak: The message now makes it clear that we don't know for a fact who sent the message, and we also include the sender's IP address, which makes it less likely this feature will be used in an abusive way. (There are some real sick people out there.)"/>

					<outline text="In 1981 and 1982 I used CompuServe's CB Radio, which was early chatroom software, maybe the first, and for two years I actively participated in the CB Radio community. I had just left Personal Software, had plenty of money (for those days) and was writing and running &lt;a href=&quot;http://dave.editthispage.com/outlinersProgramming#lbbs&quot;&gt;LBBS&lt;/a&gt; and developing user interfaces that took advantage of the power of the personal computer. I did a program called CB Mama, which was a graphic app that allowed you to talk to as many as a dozen people at one time, each in a separate window. (Windows were the big thing then, the Xerox Star was hot, kind of like P2P was last year.)"/>
					<outline text="We had CB Radio dinners in SF, just like the Scripting News dinners we have now. I wanted to run my BBS software in the CompuServe cloud, but they were deaf to such inquiries. Much later the Web would come around and open the cloud to everyone and now there are all kinds of connections between the Web and IRC, ICQ, IM, etc, all of which are descendents of CB Radio on CompuServe."/>
					<outline text="Last night I decided to find out what ICQ is like. My number is 130183294. It's supposedly the richest instant messaging software and community. &lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.manilasites.com/&quot;&gt;Scoble&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the first ICQ users (his number is 163561) guided me through the software on the telephone. I chatted for a bit with Aaron Swartz. And we looked all over the place to get a quick idea of all the things they do in ICQ today."/>

					<outline text="A few months ago a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/101.jsp&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; appeared entitled &lt;i&gt;Java APIs for XML RPC.&lt;/i&gt; I sent an email to Anne Thomas-Manes, strenuously objecting. The document didn't point to &quot;XML-RPC&quot;, although it attempts to survey the landscape in XML-over-HTTP protocols. XML-RPC was the first such protocol, and arguably is the most used, with 45 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/directory/1568/implementations&quot;&gt;implementations&lt;/a&gt; (including Java), a frozen spec, and a very active developer community. "/>
					<outline text="Their lawyers got in the loop and claimed that they had the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; to confuse developers and users, however, as a &quot;courtesy to Dave Winer,&quot; they changed the document and the crisis was over. Yesterday &lt;a href=&quot;http://mynakada.weblogs.com/2001/09/05&quot;&gt;Paul Nakada&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the document is back in its original form, with support from lots of companies you've heard of. This is disturbing. It isn't about me, forget the courtesy, try self-respect and support for independent developers. "/>
					<outline text="People who work at Big Companies tend only to respect people who work at other BigCo's. We could help them stay in the market if they just worked with us -- instead they pick on us. Unbelievable.  "/>
					<outline text="BTW, I got an email from Anne saying she had left Sun to work at Idoox. Perhaps that has something to do with this nasty reversal."/>
					<outline text="Bottom-line, if you work at Sun, or work at one of their partner companies, especially if your company is listed as a supporter on that &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/101.jsp&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;, get in touch with the people responsible for this work and ask them to get in touch with the XML-RPC community. Instead of trying to roll us over (why?) -- work with us. We want a multi-party system. We don't want to get in the trunk with Microsoft. We want our independence, and for that, we want to see Java stay strong. Be intellectually honest. The term XML-RPC means something. Respect that, and enhance it. Thanks for listening."/>

					<outline text="Adam and Scoble have discovered a secret. I have a story to go with this of course. In the late 80s, a freshly minted millionaire, totally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=nouveau%20riche&quot;&gt;nouveau riche&lt;/a&gt;, I got involved with a project led by Stewart Alsop and various wives of rich venture capitalists to bring computers into education. They gave money to game designers to create educational games for the kids. I felt that we should use the money to buy computers to put in classrooms, with email software, and let the kids use them. I had seen my own writing skills zoom by using email in the 70s on Unix systems. When the only way to communicate is through your writing, then writing skills develop. That's how I became a writer. And of course it did eventually happen. Today lots of kids use email and instant messaging and cellphones. They invent their own language. They're much better writers than my generation, which was raised with paper, pencil and typewriters as the tools for writing."/>
					<outline text="Following that principle, then the role of computers in education is simple. Make the tools available to students, teachers, administrators and families. Teach them how to use the tools (there's something educators should be able to do!) and kick back and just let them use them. See what skills each of the tools develops and provide that information to the people who create the software. "/>

In a critical piece of code that's executed a lot, they found that C, the speed of light, was being saved, squared, then the code would execute, and before returning, the original value was restored. This optimization had been in place for a few years, with no clear adverse effects on the universe. But what if one of the CPUs failed before the value was restored?

					<outline text="On this day last year: &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/09/02/whatToDoAboutRss&quot;&gt;What to do about RSS?&lt;/a&gt; "/>
					<outline text="&quot;RSS, in its simplicity, is a breath of fresh air. You can understand it fully in a few minutes. You can quickly deploy an application with just a basic understanding of HTML and a bit of experience in a scripting language like Perl, AppleScript or Python. That is the reason it gained traction, while most other XML formats are still in the working groups or waiting for deployment. In the overworked world of Web development, there's no time to study, there's only time to do.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="So one year later what happened there? Basically RSS went crazy and self-destructed."/>
					<outline text="To me it felt like being corrected by arrogant teachers, ones indoctrinated in a philosophy that was failing. I could see it, but they didn't. One year later, RDF still hasn't happened in any real way, it's still Tim Berners-Lee's dream, one I wish hadn't gotten in the way of the work we were doing in easy Web content syndication."/>
					<outline text="Traffic on the lists has dropped to a trickle, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; for people using the RDF fork. Is one year enough time to try their experiment? If not, how much longer do they need to prove that the Web wants to be Semantic or even has a clue what that means."/>
					<outline text="But the RSS community persists. Jeff Barr is running the &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsfeeds.manilasites.com&quot;&gt;newsfeeds&lt;/a&gt; weblog and pointing to lots of new sources. Most of them are 0.91. We shipped Radio, which has a built-in RSS-based aggregator, and can be used to author RSS feeds, and it inspired competition. "/>
					<outline text="Before last summer I was one of the sources of evangelism for RSS, maybe even the primary one, but after the persistent flamewars on the Syndication list, I couldn't recommend it -- to do so would require too many caveats and warnings about the mess people would be stepping into. This happened when the ICE group expressed an interest in RSS. I counseled against it. Stay away, don't get bogged down."/>
					<outline text="This should serve as a warning to anyone who invests in a standard whose authorship is at all in question. If I had it to do again I would have stuck with the XML format I invented and would have supported RSS, instead of joining my format with RSS and deprecating the old one. Then RSS could have gone crazy and we would have still been able to move forward."/>
					<outline text="RSS is an awkward state, half-alive, but it's not clear what it is. A lot of people have poured their hearts into it, but it's not clear now what good its done."/>

"/>
					<outline text="There's a circle in the center of the page which represents the idealogical firewall of open source. Describing that would take a short essay. But let's assume it's really there. Source code flows from inside the circle to the outside. Interestingly, none of the major open source scripting tools and runtimes are controlled by a GPL license, nor is Apache. So, for these projects, technology flows out of the circle without restriction."/>
					<outline text="Two circles intersect with the open source circle, one for BigCo's and one for Independent Developers. I made these circles separate because the two groups behave quite differently. Independents don't want to be everything to everyone. Even though I put AOL in the BigCo circle, interestingly, they behave more like an independent. But they are so big they must be in the Big circle. I made the two circles the same size, because I believe if all the indies work together (a big if of course) they're just as powerful (if not more so) than The Bigs. Two new additions to the Independent circle are VA Linux and CollabNet, both of whom are now mixed commercial and open source developers. UserLand is in the Independent Developer circle."/>
					<outline text="Inside the open source circle at the center of the page are the various parts that make up &lt;i&gt;the idea&lt;/i&gt; of open source today: Leaders, Developers, Money, Press, XML, and Slashdot."/>
					<outline text="Leaders are the most visible, they're the handle by which most people pick up open source. They are quoted in the press, the VCs invested in them, they're linked to from Slashdot, and they have even exerted power in XML. The system is built on the presence of the leaders. People have said that we should ignore the leaders, but to have done so would have missed what's going on in the connection between money and open source and press. As the pure open source companies reposition, and the idealogical leaders scramble, we can see clearly that money played a big role, as it always does."/>
					<outline text="The developers inside the main circle are those who create open source without a business model. People who moonlight, teens who are in school, or people who otherwise do open source strictly for love. Source code flows out of the circle, created by these people, but they're very often unsung heroes."/>
					<outline text="Money fueled the hype, but that's now over. If we redraw this picture in 2003, it will not be inside the central circle. But the money is still floating around, it's not totally spent yet. If open source is to survive in the future, money will flow into the circle from the BigCo and Independent Developer circles."/>
					<outline text="The Press will take a lot longer to fade out. They present open source as the Enemy of Microsoft. In never-ending battle of Boy vs Boy, the courageous leaders of open source take on the Evil Empire. They will not be assimilated. It's David vs Goliath for the 180th time. A battle to the end."/>
					<outline text="Slashdot is different. It's the community voice of open source, with a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=mealymouthed&quot;&gt;mealymouthed&lt;/a&gt; idiots thrown in at no extra cost. "/>
					<outline text="And finally XML. When this picture is redrawn next year, I think XML is going to be much bigger part of what's going on. It's about open interfaces, choice, and no lock-in. It makes ideas flow through the firewall, even if apps are GPL-licensed. It's the lever under Stallman, and if we're smart and really courageous, it also routes around Microsoft."/>

					<outline text="Continuing the thread on age started yesterday.."/>
					<outline text="When we're children we respect older people, that is, we listen to them. Childhood is a time of heavy software development. The computer inside us learns how to exist in the civilization it's born into. Think about it, the same evolution-created body can boot up in the 15th century or in the 21st, and be a part of either society, even though they're vastly different. Childhood can't work without a lot of listening. Then at some point we figure we've got all the info we need, and it's time to disconnect from the adults, and start creating our own world. This is called adolesence, the teen years. It often extends into the 20s and 30s and beyond. Listening cuts off dramatically at this point and the adults sometimes have a hard time dealing with this. (My father used to joke about how he would get smarter as I got older. Heh heh. Maybe so.)"/>
					<outline text="We go through different kinds of adolesences, I don't think there's a universal experience, perhaps just a common one, and perhaps my view is skewed toward the male adolesence. No sisters, just a brother, no cousins, I had classmates of course, and I had a rough adolesence, rougher than most of my peers. I really wanted to make my own way, and the culture of the time encouraged that (&quot;don't trust anyone over 30&quot;). Some of my friends just glided through this period, went straight to college, and jobs and marriages, etc. I had to invent stuff. I was pretty driven, and guess I still am."/>
					<outline text="I'm a baby-boomer, born in 1955. The generations after mine are now really hard on us. I heard a report on NPR with interviews with post-baby-boomers, saying we're very self-centered, we didn't create any art, and we're filled with contradictions, and are basically a failure because we didn't live up to the lofty ambitions we had when we were younger. I also get a lot of that in email, pushing back on my writing. &quot;Your generation is flawed,&quot; I hear coming back from younger readers. I interpret this as &quot;I don't want to listen to you.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="In defense of my generation, we did create some art, some important stuff. We don't have a Hemingway or Fitzgerald or Chagall or Picasso, or even Murrow or Cronkite; perhaps no one of us stands out as a creative genius, and we didn't overcome the admiration for wealth and materialism that we rebelled against. We still worship BigCo's and their leaders (a big mistake, they're not very smart or creative or even honest people, imho). "/>
					<outline text="But the tools and writing style of the Web didn't exist before we came along, nor did videogames, we changed popular music, maybe not as much as we think, and medicine has made a lot of progress. It took a lot of creativity and hard work to make all that happen. It wasn't all done by baby boomers, but a lot of it was. "/>
					<outline text="In good ways and bad, we're not all that different from previous generations. We like our SUVs, and condos at Tahoe, and we're struggling with our own mortality, and perhaps our breakthrough writers and composers and painters will make their mark later in life, if people are open to creativity from older folk. One can always hope."/>
