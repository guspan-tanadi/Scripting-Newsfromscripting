				<outline text="As you may &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/01/18#theNewYorkTimesAndXml&quot;&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of weeks ago I wished we could add the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and New York Times to the roster news sources syndicating in RSS. The next day a friend sent a pointer to a public Web server where XML versions of the Times feeds were being updated. Their format, while transparently simple, required conversion before it could plug into RSS-based aggregators. On this &lt;a href=&quot;http://backend.userland.com/nyTimesRssRouter&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; I describe the conversion, and point to a folder on a UserLand-run server where the RSS versions of the feeds are updated hourly. There's much more to say. They're pushing links to articles, following the grain of the Web; not pushing story content. This builds flow for their site, and allows them to add interactive features at the single canonical location for the story. It's a win for news readers and software developers, because with the Times flow in the mix, we have news that covers the world and technology, the Times book and movie reviews, art and education news, sports and editorial pages. This is by far the broadest availability of syndicated content for a major newspaper. So the Times is again a leader, not just in print, and on the Web, but also in the newest XML-based syndication technologies. Of course this raises the question &quot;Is this appropriate?&quot; and I've debated this with myself and others over and over. I've attempted to contact the Times, to let them know what we are doing. While they have not given their approval, or responded in any way, the XML files are updating and remain accessible. We are not disclosing their location or format. I see this as a potential flow-builder for the Times, and a big boost for the developing medium. While I hope the Times keeps these resources accessible, of course it's their choice." created="Wed, 31 Jan 2001 05:03:56 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Where we're at" created="Fri, 26 Jan 2001 05:17:31 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Now as CEO of UserLand, I want to comment. Take the current motto of this site seriously. As you use Manila daily, it's easy to be lulled into the belief that there's a magic thing going on that keeps your data safe. There is no such magic. We back up every night, but it's possible for us to back up a bad version of a database. At that point we cannot restore from a backup, and content, perhaps whole sites, will be lost. It happened yesterday to Rollberg News. It could have been any site. It was totally random."/>
					<outline text="Further, the system is only as good as the people running it. We have very good people at UserLand, but we're just human, and we make mistakes. We have been working long hours without enough compensation or vacations &lt;i&gt;for years.&lt;/i&gt; It takes a toll, we get less reliable as time goes by. Human error was a factor in yesterday's outage. A database reached its size limit. The software does a somewhat decent job of dealing with this situation, but it could do better. We're going to put in some new alarms that go off as yesterday's situation approaches. And if it happens that we miss the alarm, the server will shut down immediately and automatically so no further damage will occur. (Murphy-willing of course.)"/>
					<outline text="Now that's a band-aid, what are we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; going to do about this situation?"/>
					<outline text="There will come a time, probably not that far away, when we will ask people to transition to a new way to work on their UserLand-hosted Manila sites, where the data is stored on your computers, and only renderings are stored on ours. You will be able to back up your own data, and you will be able to transfer it to other software if you choose to, or render it through a variety of protocols, including FTP, to another server altogether. We think this is the responsible way forward, and one that will be good for our business. That's why we're working so hard, while keeping the servers running, to get Radio done, with its &quot;desktop website&quot; approach to content creation"/>

				<outline text="Tipjars" created="Fri, 26 Jan 2001 05:18:49 GMT" type="outline">
					<outline text="Yesterday I received a few emails from people asking where our Tipjar is. I appreciate the sentiment, but.. I'm not interested in tips, yet. Think about it this way. When you go for a meal at a restaurant you get a bill, which you pay, and you may if you choose, leave a tip. I'm interested in earning money, not having it given as a gratuity. Think about Stephen King's experiment last year to get paid for writing stuff that's distributed through the Internet. He wasn't asking for tips, he was asking to be paid. That has integrity. Asking for &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; a tip acknowledges somehow that the work itself isn't worthy. Our work is very good and worthwhile. So I will appreciate tips from paying customers who are happy with the service, but first we have to bill for it. "/>
					<outline text="Another option open to Manila users is to purchase a license for Frontier and operate a server yourself. It's not that hard to do, and it's not very expensive. One $2000 W2K box can serve a thousand sites. Add connectivity and software expenses, I would guess the first year the server would cost about $5000. That's $5 per site in the first year. In the second year it would be even less expensive. Such a server would carry a much lighter load than UserLand's servers. A safer backup policy could be implemented."/>
					<outline text="Someone's going to say we should offer $5 sites, but no way. We're not a service business, although almost by accident we have become one. Oy. We make software. We love doing that. Operating free or even inexpensive public servers is a whole different thing."/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/radioHotlist1.gif&quot;&gt;A new feature&lt;/a&gt; came online tonight in our Desktop Website project. Like every community there's the ranking thing, the place you want to be. Who's on top and who's the rising star? Our little den of RSS lovers is no exception. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Black dirt live again!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="Interesting thing about the hotlist, it recalcs every hour and is a function of who's logged in. (A login lasts 25 hours.) This morning I looked at it and my number had decreased from 11 to 7. Still tied for number one. "/>
					<outline text="BTW, we're going to release the source code for the cloud when it settles down so that all different kinds of communities can develop. It's all XML and XML-RPC/SOAP. I know of one developer working in Zope to parallel our development, and of course we welcome this."/>
					<outline text="I can also see which categories of mine people have subscribed to. A lot of people have subscribed to Scripting and Frontier, but I rarely route stories to these channels. It's as if there's a small audience waiting. So I just routed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webreference.com/dhtml/column46/&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; to Scripting, and am going to create some things to route to Frontier. Feedback in the form of a hotlist really helps. "/>
					<outline text="Another example of that is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xmlrpc.com/stats/referers&quot;&gt;Referers page&lt;/a&gt; for the XML-RPC site. As news of Eric Kidd's work spreads, the XML-RPC site is getting linked into more developer sites. And it distributes the flow to the implementors and they in turn point back to us. This is the Web doing its work, telling developers about good stuff they can use and in return encourages us to create more good stuff. "/>
					<outline text="Anyway, if the hotlist is such a good idea, then an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.userland.com/updates&quot;&gt;Updates&lt;/a&gt; page can't be far behind, right? Well, in the next level, the Updates page is much hotter. You don't get a list of sites that changed,  you get the bits from the sites, delivered into your template along with items from MacNN, The NY Times (we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ourfavoritesongs.com/users/dave@userland.com/rss/nytimes/technology.xml&quot;&gt;got&lt;/a&gt; it working!) and Salon, Herring, Wired and Fool, and a bunch of others.

					<outline text="Our tool is very simple, however behind the simplicity is a new formula for Internet applications. The rendering code and all your data reside on &lt;i&gt;your computer.&lt;/i&gt; This is important for a couple of reasons. First, we won't need to ask users to pay for servers since our servers aren't doing anything when you're blogging. Second, you control your data. This is, only now, starting to become an issue for users. It's guaranteed to become a bigger issue over time because we're repeating a loop. Back in the mainframe era data ownership became a big issue, and that resulted in the personal computer revolution, where the users took control of the data, and built their own apps, using VisiCalc, Lotus 1-2-3, dBASE, etc. In our setup, all your blog data are sitting in a scriptable database on your own machine. If other developers want to build apps that suck the data out of our database into their own, we're wide open, as they say in Japanese, gambatte."/>

Steve will say &quot;There's no real reason to ship it to stores, people can download it over the Internet.&quot; And the July date will slip. It would be suicidal for Apple to put OS X in real users faces before it's exactly a clone of Mac OS 9, with a few minor improvements that aren't in your way. Unless they're stupid or very fast (it'll never happen) Mac OS X can not be pre-installed on anything other than servers for another couple of years. Software takes time. You can't hurry love. Look at the features they're bringing online now. Core stuff. (Until a couple of weeks ago the Apple logo was in the middle of the screen for crying out loud.) It might be a management technique.

It's amazing to me that Jakob Nielsen inspires such passion. User interface guidelines, imho, are a good thing. In 1984 I had a similar pov to Dale's. But then I saw the good in standardized UIs. Not every programmer has ideas about user interface, or sometimes they have really bad ideas. The problem of course is that the Web is such a weak UI environment that even if you follow Jakob's rules (some of which I totally reject, btw) you end up with a weak user interface. Whatever.

I don't want to share my desktop machine with the world, and because of firewalls and bandwidth constraints, many people cannot. I want to use my machine in the same mode as Manila, Blogger, Pitas, Groksoup, etc, and have it publish to the cloud where everyone can read it, crawl it, filter and republish. For some reason doing as much as possible in the browser makes it easier. That's why people like these tools.
