				<outline text="How aging works, for the benefit of young and old alike. When you're young, &quot;the future&quot; translates mostly to &quot;my future.&quot; As you get older, the future gains independence. You start thinking about things you won't participate in. As you get older you can think in larger chunks of time. Not sure why this is so, experience may have something to do with it. "/>
				<outline text="BTW, older people talking about aging is another of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=taboo&quot;&gt;taboo&lt;/a&gt; topics of our day. "/>
				<outline text="More taboo-talk. Say this to a 20-something. &quot;I've learned a lot since I was your age.&quot; The idea doesn't go in easily. Try another tack. &quot;Remember when you were 14. How much have you learned since then?&quot; Oh they can go on and on about that. &quot;OK, cool, do you think learning stops at 23?&quot; It's like hitting a brick wall. Now I think they think I'm saying something like Respect your elders (maybe I am) with all the connotations of subservience that come with that (I am not doing that). Hey I wish I had the body I had in my 20s (I should dig up a picture). But I have learned a lot since then. "/>

They ran his picture and it made me shiver with fear to see how old he had become. My fear, not his. He said &quot;It seems as if only now I really know who I am. My strengths, my weaknesses, my jealousies — it's as if all of it has been boiling in a pot for all these years, and as it boils, it evaporates into steam, and all that's left in the pot in the end is your essence, the stuff you started out with in the very beginning.&quot;"/>
				<outline text="I listened to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.npr.org/freshair/dayFA.cfm?display=day&amp;todayDate=04%2F17%2F1998&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with Katherine Graham where she talked about turning 80. I found a lot I could relate to, but then again, there's the fear. She said she could never visualize herself as an old woman, but she realized that she was now exactly that. At some level it never occurred to her that &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; would get old. (BTW, Graham was a total taboo-buster. She took over the Washington Post when her husband commited suicide in 1963.)"/>
				<outline text="Maybe there's a point in life where you start really listening to people who are much older. I don't think I've quite reached that point yet, but I'm getting there. I think how much better my life would have been if I had sought out a roadmap of what was ahead. Somehow I couldn't imagine that any of it applied to me. But I'm learning as I go that it &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; applies. We create all these segments and labels, young, old, male, female, geek, PHB, etc, and think we're all so different from each other, but in the end, I think we're remarkably &lt;i&gt;alike&lt;/i&gt; inside. "/>
				<outline text="Back to what Kirk Douglas was saying. When you're in your 80s every moment counts, you don't have much future at all, and if you're paying attention you know that. Now if some of that can go back to younger people (like me!) well, what an incredible gift. That's why it's worth listening. (That's all respect means to me, let people speak for themselves, it's harder to do, to really do, that it might seem it should be.)"/>
				<outline text="Now you might ask, why do I keep busting taboos instead of being a good boy. I do it because I want to meet other people who like busting taboos. Those are the people I can work with. People of all genders, all ages, all whatever. It's an algorithm, a filter. "/>

				<outline text="Interesting results. At first the Yes votes dominated the No's, but then the No's caught up and all afternoon they've been running in an absolute dead heat. As I write this at 6PM, there are 66 Yes's and 66 No's. FYI, I voted No. It's not polite to call someone an idiot, even if there's no doubt about it. Aside from that it's impractical, I just checked, and today alone there would be an uncountable number of idiots (e.g. all the people who went long on RHAT in late 1999). &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>

				<outline text="BTW, I got some pushback from people reading my comments the other &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/08/28#platforms&quot;&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; about OSes getting in front of the apps. Here's a good example of that. The reporter is so confused that he puts the OS in front about a technical issue when it totally is not. Part of the reason Apple has this problem is that its product is not the OS, it's Steve Jobs. They're probably right that Steve is incompatible with a broad &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=inclusive&quot;&gt;inclusive&lt;/a&gt; strategy, but the OS doesn't have that bug. In the end, does it matter that there's a difference between Steve and the platform? This thought may be a little sophisticated for some of my less intelligent readers."/>

				<outline text="David Adams &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stuffeddog.com/news/1999100402.html&quot;&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; when, in 10/99, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1999/10/02&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; Red Hat's market cap of $5.8 billion. I asked if it was smoke and mirrors. He called it hate and paranoia. Hmmm. Here's what I said. &quot;When you sell a commodity you're very open to price competition. Distribution is a thin business model. In the shakeout that followed one of the CEOs of one of the leading distributers likened it to flying at a thousand miles an hour two feet off the ground.

My own two cents. As a forty-something, my eyes are getting weaker, so I would love to use this technology if it allows me to adjust the size of the type. I tend to favor books with larger type, they're easier for me to read. The reason I haven't adopted it is two-fold. 1. I don't like how they've been marketed, mostly as a solution to problems that the publishers have (extensive copy protection) and  2. my belief that most books are not available for the readers. "/>

The business model for Web Services is choice. The reason to use a publicly-defined protocol with wide support to connect components is that we can swap in different implementations when we want to. There's not much more to it. You could call it freedom, or choice, or freedom of choice. We provide a Web Services interface to Manila to make the product more attractive. It's an important feature for our users, or will be, because it means they can migrate if they want to. Intelligent users and developers migrate &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; systems that don't lock them in, not away from them. These are the people we want."/>

					<outline text="I'm having lunch with Microsoft's Jim Allchin on Tuesday. Dan Gillmor was invited too, but can't make it because he's beginning a round-the-world trip today. Have a great trip Dan. He promises to update us from the road. "/>
					<outline text="So, what will we talk about on Tuesday. You can help there. I had a phone talk with a Microsoft PR guy yesterday to prep for the meeting. I said I'm looking for win-wins. I was opposed to breaking up Microsoft for a long time, but they didn't show any will for self-restraint, and I didn't see any way for independent developers to win with Microsoft. But nothing's that simple. I appreciate Microsoft. While the open source bluster was wrecking my market, Microsoft invested in us, by helping create SOAP. They were friendly to us when others left us for dead. I don't forget this."/>
					<outline text="I also spoke with Dan yesterday. He said he was very excited about what's going on between Jabber and Blogger with XML-RPC. I can work with that, for sure. At least the conversation is off Microsoft for a few minutes. I like that. Now, of course it immediately swung to Microsoft, as all conversations in the software industry quickly do. I asked Dan to consider approaching them from a different angle, and I'm going to ask all of you to do that as well."/>
					<outline text="Remember that it's a 45K person company. Read Breaking Windows. You can see that there are a lot of threads inside Microsoft. They don't all march in lock-step to the will of Bill. When Dan condemns Microsoft, he's disempowering those at Microsoft who want the company to change, who remember what a fast-growing software ecology looks like, and understand how stifled the market is by Microsoft's dominance."/>
					<outline text="I got a great email yesterday from Rob Fahrni, who works at Microsoft on Visio. We exchanged a little email after he helped me by Visio-izing my hand-drawn block diagram. Here's what he said. &quot;What you guys are doing reminds me of the early days at Visio. Back when we just slammed code and got stuff done! I'm really excited about this stuff. I'm trying to steal time at night to work on a C++ implementation to post to Blogger, and now Manila! Thanks for creating XML-RPC, it's way slick!&quot;"/>
					<outline text="So don't tell me Microsoft is evil because my friend Rob works there. Now, so do other people who have no appreciation for the kind of joyful creativity that only free developers can practice. I want to help Rob if I can, and others at Microsoft, those who remain, with bright eyes, who think that creativity happens outside the confines of Microsoft."/>
					<outline text="So I asked Dan to state his terms for approval of Microsoft. What would they have to do in order for you to become a fan, instead of a constant critic? Then I realized I should do what I asked Dan to do. State my terms. So here I go again."/>
					<outline text="To the leadership at Microsoft, here's what I want from you. First, go talk to Rob. Ask him why he's excited. Let that guide you -- what can you do to grow the software industry today? Right now, imho, the best thing you can do is pull out of areas that you control exclusively and let the market do its job. "/>
					<outline text="Offer choice everywhere you don't. We know you know how to do APIs. Make the identity server in XP subject to user choice. Give developers an API and give the user choice. This makes the UI a little more complex, but it will foster growth, and as the largest entity in the software industry, growth at this level is necessary to &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; growth and survival. The ecosystem is horribly out of balance. To restore balance, you must get out of the way."/>
					<outline text="Decouple the evolution of the browser from the operating system and the apps. This is where you got nailed by the Appeals Court. Eight judges say you screwed up, and this developer says you screwed up too. In the past you've made the mistake of dissing both developers and judges. Now it's caught up with you. But it's not such a bad deal, now you're so big, &lt;i&gt;you don't need&lt;/i&gt; the protection that tied monopolies give you. You don't even have to be the best to win, just good enough."/>
					<outline text="Most people don't realize this, but Microsoft isn't as smart as it used to be. The average Softie today doesn't remember what it was like to win through competition. They're more adept at dealing with internal politics than they are at understanding ecosystems and fostering network effects. I may have a unique view into this because I live in the ecosystem, I've never worked at a company big enough to create the kind of internal noise that a 45K person company can, and I've somewhat successfully navigated the politics at Microsoft, as an outsider. Today's Microsoft reminds me more of Apple of the late 80s than it does of Microsoft of the late 80s. It also has a lot of the IBM of the early 80s. To the leadership at Microsoft, &lt;i&gt;you need us&lt;/i&gt; to figure out where to go next. Your overhead is stifling to itself. Let's get it to stop stifling those who don't work at Microsoft."/>
					<outline text="And drop the patents, it's OK to trade them with other BigCo's, can't stop that, but don't accelerate the war. You'll be blamed for that. The threat that Mundie made to the open source developers is unseemly for a company of Microsoft's size and stature. "/>
					<outline text="Net-net, Microsoft has made a total mess of its relationship with independent developers. The gaffe in OpenSourceLand is only the latest outrage. The fight with Java developers over WORA, the locked trunk that killed the HTML developer world was another. Depriving other platforms of air supply may be a good short term tactic, but if you want the trust of developers, stop the threats, treat us like a market, give us what we want, and help us drive markets. We've been through this so many times before. Stop and think, and ask if you believe that a super-BigCo can create all the growth you need, and if you really think it through, you'll realize that it can't."/>

					<outline text="One week ago, last Friday, I started work on bloggerApi.root, a guest database that, when installed alongside Manila, implements support for the Blogger API. While I was in Colorado, while the Jabber guys were breaking through with Blogger, Jake was finishing bloggerApi.root."/>
					<outline text="We did it in two steps. First, we implemented a set of ManilaRPC methods that do functionally what the Blogger API does. (Docs will follow on these). Then we implemented connective glue in bloggerApi.root that calls these methods, and deployed it quietly on all our servers. We then told the Jabber guys how to call it. It worked. So now we're ready to release this code to Frontier developers. "/>

I created a new account for a fictitious user named John Q. Public. We also released an example script that creates a new post, edits it, creates another, and deletes it. Here's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/images/bloggerManilaTestScript.gif&quot;&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;, in which the account name and password are highlighted. Please be kind to our server, we're doing this because we want developers in all environments to connect up to this new capability."/>

On that page you'll find a link to bloggerApi.root, and an explanation of how the Blogger API is implemented in Manila. This is important if you're running Manila sites or if you're implementing the client side of the Blogger API and want to work with Manila. The interface is transparent, Manila works exactly as Blogger does, but if you're making assumptions about blogId's and postId's you may want to see how they work in Manila. Also others who are cloning the Blogger API may want to look here for prior art."/>

					<outline text="Now, let me explain what's going on there. Dave Smith, who posted that message, typed that text into a Jabber client, where it was routed to his Manila site through the Blogger API. He could just as easily have used it to post to a Blogger site. In other words, we've reached the milestone -- we now have the Blogger API working for news-item-oriented Manila sites. This means that if you have a toolkit for Blogger, you should be able to use it to get, post, edit and delete items on a Manila site."/>

				<outline text="Tunneling XML-RPC with Jabber">
					<outline text="We had a session yesterday, just a little over an hour, where we designed a new thing, a way of combining the power of Jabber to tunnel across firewalls and NATs with the ability to link programs across the Internet through XML-RPC."/>
					<outline text="It's almost as if the two protocols, XML-RPC and Jabber, were designed to be integrated. We share similar philosophies, simplicity comes first, and both are totally open, and most important, the people involved in both protocols have a let's-get-it-done-now attitude. Further, Jabber has not (to my surprise) evolved to include the functionality of XML-RPC, and XML-RPC, if it's to be as powerful as instant messaging, has to have someway to traverse NATs and firewalls."/>
					<outline text="So we came up with something called Jabber-RPC, which carries messages that are formatted according to the XML-RPC spec over a new transport -- Jabber."/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pipetree.com/jabber/jrpc.html&quot;&gt;DJ Adams says&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;It's not that this hasn't been done before - it has, multiple times - but until now we have neither known about each other's work nor used the same techniques. So in order to be able to work together and have our code interoperate, we've come up with a formalisation upon which we all agree.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="And that was the cool thing -- agreement was reached in a little over one hour!"/>
					<outline text="What a community."/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="A new writing surface for blogging">
					<outline text="OK, the second thing we accomplished, which is not related to the Tunneling described above, is the connect between Jabber instant messaging and weblogs. Apparently, totally independent of the developments in Blogger's XML-RPC API, which started on August 8, this month the Jabber community discovered weblogs. Murphy works in strange ways. This lead to a one-off weblogging tool called Jogger, a proof of concept -- leading to the next step, a connection with the tools that are focused on weblogging -- Blogger, Manila, and (we hope soon) LiveJournal and others."/>
					<outline text="Here's the sequence of events. We have a very large XML-RPC interface for Manila which is the basis for the connection between Radio and Manila. It allows you to edit all parts of a Manila site with Radio's outliner. It's very powerful (and complex for newbies). In early August, Evan Williams at Blogger started putting a public XML-RPC interface on Blogger. It's quite simple (that's good). As soon as I got back from NY we started implementing the client side, so Radio could be used to edit Blogger sites. It worked, and we released the code, and others are using it now. Then late last week I started cloning the Blogger API so that any tools that were created for Blogger could also be used with Manila. I didn't get all the way there, but while I was in Colorado, Jake Savin finished it and deployed it on one of our servers. (We'll announce the location and put up a public demo site later today.)"/>
					<outline text="On Monday night, DizzyD (aka Dave Smith), one of the Jabber developers, lead a team who made it so that Jabber's instant messaging user interface could be used to post items to a Blogger blog using this interface. This is the block diagram Jeremie and I put together that Craig documented on his site. Basically here's how it works. A connection is created in the Jabber server that knows how to post to a specific weblog. It stores the URL of the site, the username and password, and whatever other information is needed. Then when the user enters an item that begins with a magic string, it routes the text to the weblog. People who live in the IM interface, who see it as their primary writing surface, now have a totally comfortable way to post to a weblog. "/>
					<outline text="Now, because we have also implemented the Blogger API for Manila, the same code in the Jabber cloud can be used to post to a news-item-oriented Manila site. Later today Dizzy and Jake, working together, will demonstrate this, and of course you'll hear all about it here on Scripting News."/>
					<outline text="Now a bit of philosophy. This is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/2000/11/30/bootstrapping&quot;&gt;bootstrapping&lt;/a&gt;. It's the way new functionality gets into all our products. It's the way the pure engineering mind works. It's how we create magic by working together."/>

				<outline text="A new slogan">
					<outline text="Doc gave a fantastic presentation. I had never seen one of his slide shows. I really hope we get it on the Web in some meaningful way so you all can see that not only is Doc one of our best writers, he's also one of our best public speakers."/>
					<outline text="After his presentation we had a public conversation, me and Doc, and as usual I don't know who to attribute this to -- call it a Doc-Dave collaboration. Here's the slogan -- Just Say Yes -- it's a flip on Nancy Reagan's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan/nancy/just_say_no.asp&quot;&gt;admonition&lt;/a&gt; about illegal drugs. "/>
					<outline text="When you get a proposal from another developer to be compatible, your knee-jerk reaction should be this: &lt;i&gt;Yes.&lt;/i&gt;"/>
					<outline text="We need this reminder, because so often the knee-jerk reaction is the opposite."/>
					<outline text="Now here's why I love the Jabber community: They didn't need to hear this. It was already their philosophy."/>
					<outline text="Now let's spread the gospel!"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="I love SOAP">
					<outline text="Already I have gotten an email saying &quot;You obviously support XML-RPC, but seem to be cautious about SOAP - what it is about SOAP that you feel can't be implemented on all platforms?&quot;"/>
					<outline text="I love human minds. Absent facts they fill in the blanks -- and draw an incorrect conclusion."/>
					<outline text="The Jabber and Blogger communities both chose XML-RPC over SOAP. You can ask them if you want, but I didn't steer them one way or the other. I didn't say &quot;You should do SOAP&quot; when they chose XML-RPC. Either are great. I love them both, as a father might love both his children. I encourage everyone to use SOAP. I encourage everyone to use XML-RPC."/>
					<outline text="I have set it up so that my company doesn't care which one you use. But please wire up your Internet applications so they can be scripted in this manner so the magic can happen. Do it sooner than later. "/>

					<outline text="Brian Mulvaney: \&quot;Another solution is to run a SMTP process locally. I use a tiny freeware mail server from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.argosoft.com/&quot;&gt;Argosoft&lt;/a&gt;  because I'm on the road a lot,  connecting from different networks.  All you need to do to configure it is  to give it the name of a DNS server (any reliable one should do) and turn  on relaying.  You then set your email client to send mail to the local  machine (127.0.0.1).  That's it.  It's kind of fun to watch the log for the  mail server as it makes connections and gets the mail out.   I don't leave  it running for long periods of time if I'm on a fixed IP address because of  the open relay, but that's generally not an issue when I'm on the road.\&quot;"/>

The Mac creamed the IBM PC, not the other way around, because it had a better memory model than the PC. Sure the PC was more open, but that lead to competing methods of extending its memory. The market went with the Mac which had no such confusion. Of course then it swung back around to Windows, but I think that's because Microsoft did a better job of moving their platform while Apple was stagnating."/>

					<outline text="I am surprised to see all the ink over the demise of the Industry Standard. For example, it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/18/opinion/18SAT1.html&quot;&gt;top item&lt;/a&gt; on the editorial page of today's NY Times. I didn't think it was that important a publication. In the era of electronic publishing, when networking came to the masses, what sense did it make to launch a new &lt;i&gt;paper&lt;/i&gt; magazine to cover the network? "/>
					<outline text="I only went to one Standard &quot;roof party&quot; and thought it was interesting, but not interesting enough to go back. Lots of MBA carpetbaggers with eyes glazed over about their business models, newly minted mega-millionaires (been there done that) -- there was no soul there. "/>
					<outline text="I thought the coincident demise of Be is more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=portentous&quot;&gt;portentous&lt;/a&gt; of what's-to-come. The Standard was a magazine. Yeah it was thick. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idg.com/home&quot;&gt;IDG&lt;/a&gt; thought it was a loser so they shut it down. "/>
					<outline text="Double-click on &quot;more portentous of what's-to-come.&quot; When the software industry goes into a tailspin, huge amounts of technology gets flushed. The software industry was in terrible shape before the Web happened. Yes, the Web is wonderful, but.. We flushed a lot of user interface know-how in the move to the Web. My fear is that the same will happen again. "/>
					<outline text="Preserving technology now is a high priority. When the industry comes back (Murphy-willing) there will be a new twist, patents. If we don't at least archive what we know, it will be a lawyer-dominated wasteland, even more lunatic than the dotcom boom. Without good archives we'll be defenseless."/>
					<outline text="I wonder if the owners of the Standard would allow their website to be archived and the domain mapped to another server? When MacWEEK shut down we lost a lot of data as all the links went bad. Maybe it seems insensitive to worry about that now, but it would be a final act of kindness to the Web to keep the URLs live even after the magazine has ceased to publish."/>

				<outline text="Exploring the blues">
					<outline text="Mental health tip. If you ever get the blues, try getting your car washed. Just getting out of the house sometimes makes it better. And what's not to like about a clean car! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1996/12/02/AllIWantforChristmas#gotTheBlues&quot;&gt;12/2/96&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Here's a recipe for curing the blues, or at least giving them a chance to recede.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="So then I followed the pointer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/stories/storyReader$106&quot;&gt;The Little Bird&lt;/a&gt; piece. I wrote it before there were weblogs, when the only kind of feedback I got was through email. When I wrote pieces like that some people would share their personal stories and I liked that a lot. These days there are more young people around so I mostly stick to technology, thinking stuff, because that's what younger people seem to like, they often seem threatened by &quot;personal&quot; stuff even if it isn't really personal. Today, most people in the weblog world probably would think &quot;Oh there goes Dave again.&quot; OK, coool, here I go again! &quot;;-&gt;&quot;"/>
					<outline text="Here's a story. There's this huge gap, starting at the age of five or eight when people have this illusion that they've grown up. Many people never wake up from the illusion. But get this -- no one here is grown up. Like the ogre in Shrek, we're layered like onions, we're every age we've ever been every moment. Inside our bodies we swoosh through time, through all our experiences, applying the patterns we learned, against what our senses say is happening right now. Then we live the memory not the moment. Guess what I'm dreaming now, and guess what, so are you. None of what you think is happening is actually happening. Same here. (That's the problem with thinking so much.)"/>
					<outline text="Now some people wake up to this around age forty or so. I have a theory why the wakeup happens at forty, based on an old wives tale of sorts that says for every year in a relationship you have to spend a year on the other side healing from it. So if you're in a three year relationship, you'll be over it three years after its over. "/>
					<outline text="Now most people leave their parents' home at around 18 or so, give or take. And of course all your adult relationships are merely replays of the primary relations that formed your strategies in life, the ones with your parents (or adult caregiver), brothers, sisters -- whoever was around when you were an infant. "/>
					<outline text="So about 18 years after you break up with them you'll be ready to live your life for real, assuming you didn't just hop from one mess into another that's just like it. It's kind of depressing to think that you spend your childhood developing these horrible dependencies, and then it takes another childhood-span of time to get over it. But it seems to match my experience, and others. Around forty, esp if there's been some kind of disruption, a breakup, an illness or death of someone close to you, some kind of failure -- the bottom drops out, reality starts showing up (just a little), and like a child waking from a nightmare all you want is to back to sleep."/>
					<outline text="And most of the time that's what life is -- a dream, sweet, or bad or otherwise."/>
					<outline text="So here's why the algorithm for getting out of a funky mood works. The blues are your inner four year old feeling unloved and in danger of being abandoned by The Other (your adult caregiver, the person who, if they abandoned you, would cause your death). Doing something nice for yourself tricks the child into thinking that The Other loves you and is caring for you. The inner child has no idea who got the car washed, or even what a car is. It just knows that it feels cared for. And that's all he or she wants, that's all it needs -- the feeling that death is not imminent. (And by the way you're not really fooling the child, by doing something nice for yourself you are actually showing that you care for yourself.)"/>
					<outline text="And one more thing, don't dis the child. While it is primitive and helpless, it also drives your life. Your conscious will is like one of those scooters the kids like these days. Your subconscious, the inner child, is an 18-wheel semi-trailer going 120 miles per hour down a one-lane road. You gotta work with it if you want to stay on the road."/>

Seybold is the leading publishing-technology conference. We have room for one or two more panelists. We're going to try to get the CEO of Adobe, since they are at the center of the current controversy. I'd also like to have someone on stage who's an expert in the technology of DRM, and someone who can explain it in human terms and make it interesting. Please send suggestions. I am not an expert in this area, which is good since I'm the moderator and the advocate for the audience. I will also make it clear upfront that I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backIssues/2001/08/05&quot;&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; copy protection, and find laws that trade off free speech against the economic interests of publishers as something of a contradiction."/>

I went through the Scripting News &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnewsarchive.userland.com/1997/12/11&quot;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt; for that period, and used Google to find articles dating back to those events. Unhappily many of them were gone. News.Com, which has so far been great at maintaining archives is starting to slip. And all the links to the SJ Merc are gone, which is bad, esp considering that Dan Gillmor was quoted in the excerpt, terming Microsoft's response &quot;Compliance with a raised middle finger.&quot; I only link to those pages that still exist. (Postscript: Dan put his column on his weblog. Thanks Dan!)"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/insites/dvorak/jd971103.htm&quot;&gt;John Dvorak&lt;/a&gt;, 11/3/97: &quot;Apparently, Microsoft doesn't see the Justice Department as much more than a bug that simply needs to be brushed off its arm or sprayed with DDT. At least that appears to be the case considering the way Microsoft keeps using publicity to its advantage. Unfortunately, that publicity tends to mock government bureaucrats, and that's not a good long-term strategy. Neither is the strategy of proclaiming Internet Explorer to be part of the operating system. That's just plain silly. What other part of the OS, for example, runs on a Mac?&quot;"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.siliconvalley.com/content/sv/2001/08/14/opinion/dgillmor/weblog/finger.htm&quot;&gt;Dan Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;, 12/16/97: &quot;The company accurately brags that it employs some of the most capable programmers on the planet. It might consider asking them to use their talents to comply with the spirit of the order, too.&quot;"/>
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/content/zdnn/1217/264163.html&quot;&gt;ZDNet&lt;/a&gt;, 12/17/97: &quot;Last week, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft to stop requiring hardware vendors to include IE on their machines as a condition of installing Windows. Earlier this week, Microsoft appealed the preliminary injunction, while offering a plan to put the company in compliance. This plan consisted of offering OEMs the option of licensing the original release of Windows 95, which did not include integrated IE 3.0 files. Microsoft's competitors and market analysts have questioned whether such an unattractive option is within the bounds of compliance.&quot;"/>

					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/1997/52/b3559145.htm&quot;&gt;Business Week&lt;/a&gt;, 12/18/97: &quot;In a move that flaunted the injunction, Microsoft dreamed up this 'choice'': PC makers can delete Internet Explorer files from Windows 95--not a very viable option since Microsoft warns that doing so could render the operating system useless. Or they can ship their PCs with a version of the operating system that is more than two years old and lacks the browser as well as key enhancements added to Windows since then. Or stick with the latest version of Windows with Internet Explorer, for the same price. It's not hard to figure out which option PC makers will choose. The Justice Dept. was not amused by this maneuver. On Dec. 17, it filed a contempt motion.&quot;"/>

Open any outline in Radio, it could be your notepad or just a random outline on your local system, and start typing a blog entry. When you want to post, choose a menu command. It sends an XML-RPC message to Blogger telling it to create a new entry and leaves an attribute invisibly attached to the headline that remembers the ID for the entry. Then if you want to make a change, edit the headline, and choose the command. It's smart, it won't create a new post, rather it will tell Blogger to change the already-existing post.

(The rest of his stuff, well, some people don't program, and for them, yes, they can have the benefit of content management, but that's another subject.) Now, I think this is what the Moose meant to say: designers without content management are working too hard. And doing menial work. No designer wants to hear that they have to manually reflow the content of an entire site through the templates just to change GreatCompany.Com to The Great Company. Let the users do it themselves. Designers are using moose-drawn carriages. Content management gives them automatic transmission and a luxurious rocket-powered ride -- it lets them do more with less time, and keeps them doing stuff they like to do -- designing, and &lt;i&gt;no time&lt;/i&gt; doing what scripts like to do -- mindless moose-like poop."/>

Mitch and I used to be close friends in the early 80s when we were both at Personal Software, the company that was made famous by VisiCalc. Mitch, of course, went on to create Lotus 1-2-3 (see below), and is one of the founders of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;EFF&lt;/a&gt;, and until recently was a venture capitalist at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accel.com/&quot;&gt;Accel Partners&lt;/a&gt;.

It was only a two-hour meeting, with a short walk, but it's amazing how much we covered in such a short time. Mitch groks software like no one else. What an amazing mind he has. It felt, later, like reconnecting with a family member, we have a lot in common, are about the same age, Jewish transplants in California, born in Brooklyn. We're the older generation now, and perhaps not surprisingly, we parse today's world in much the same way. There will be a lot more to say about this meeting, and I hope quite a few more to come. (Also, he's is going to start a Manila site, we're going to host it for him.)"/>

				<outline text="Dear friends and family and lurkers. My trip to NY is in its last hours. Today I had breakfast with a reporter, went to a long meeting at a partner company, and met with a famous blogger. I have adjusted to the slow Internet line, have configured my emailer to not download attachments (thanks for all the suggestions) and have even learned to use my laptop on my lap. I spent a lot of time with family and no one yelled at anyone. We're getting older, maybe wiser and more forgiving too. My mom gave me an album of pictures of my early life, including every class picture from kindergarten through grade nine. I feel a real sense of accomplishment. I'm going to do one more run to the 2nd Avenue Deli for a roast beef on rye with lettuce and mayo, then walk around the city. Tomorrow morning I fly back to California, in time for the 20th anniversary of the PC reunion in San Jose. This NY trip has been great. Thanks to all the NYers who made it so!"/>

				<outline text="The helicopter ride was great but short and quite expensive. NY is overwhelming. Sorry for the lack of new posts, slow net connection, my mind is elsewhere. Hope everyone's having a great weekend. Read the review of Breaking Windows, and get a copy for yourself. Everyone who's in the tech business in some way, even people who just use the stuff, should know how the industry really works. "/>
				<outline text="Another subject we're going to cover in more detail is the case of the Russian programmer who's in an American jail for breaking the Digital Milennium Copyright Act. The act makes it illegal to write software that unlocks a copy protection scheme. It's an interesting philosophy, and a loop back to the 80s when such software was not only legal, but was instrumental in getting software publishers to see that copy protection was anti-user. There were several major software companies in the 80s in the US in the business of creating and updating such software to work around successively more complex copy protection schemes. They won awards from the PC software magazines. The leading company, Central Point Software, merged with Symantec. These were considered indispensible utilities. "/>
				<outline text="Now there are arguments on both sides. I know the publisher's side, because I was on that side in the 80s. The position is that users can't be trusted to do the right thing, to pay for the software they use. Before you laugh, there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; lots of people who use computers, many more today than in the 80s, who can't be trusted in this way. They will take the software they want and not pay for it. On the other side are users who do pay, whether or not there are copy protection hurdles. They argue that they shouldn't have to give up functionality, or put up with time-wasting nuisances, because other people are dishonest. Now there's a counter to that argument. What else is new? (I'm in NY, after all.) You may someday miss a plane because of a long line at airport security. Life is filled with annoyances like that. On the other hand, the users say this is not a matter of life and death, the worst that happens is that some rich software company is deprived of their revenue. (But most software companies are not rich.) Why should they care about that? And if you make piracy illegal, isn't that enough? And is it safe computing to not have a good backup of your work and the programs use to access the data? And does the punishment fit the crime? In the United States, where we value freedom above all else (or used to) do we really want to put programmers in jail for writing software that users want?"/>
				<outline text="In the 80s I argued with users about this, and then woke up and realized that I didn't have much of a business if I was arguing with my users. The DMCA is a terrible law, it's un-American, anti-user, and beneath us, and restraining of free speech, and probably won't stand a constitutionality test, much as the Communication Decency Act didn't. It's true that the Internet introduces some new challenges, but we must have a clear philosophy, and putting programmers in jail should raise everyone's awareness to what's coming in the future. More of this, for sure. Would you be willing to go to jail for your beliefs?"/>

It provides, finally, a live data network for Starbucks for their own corporate purposes; 3.

				<outline text="Microsoft's poisoned ecosystem">
					<outline text="Based on email, people are confused about yesterday's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2001/08/01#watchTheVideo&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; about Microsoft and patents. Let me try to clear it up. "/>
					<outline text="Microsoft files and gets lots of patents. Last week for the first time they said they will use patents to limit competition. That means if you produce software that uses some technique that Microsoft has patented, they'll either make you take the feature out or send you a bill. "/>
					<outline text="Now suppose you're an open source developer, doing it for love, not money. They're going to shut you down. Let's say you're a small commercial developer trying to prove an idea so you can get funding. Yup, you're out of the game too. Maybe you're IBM with a huge hoard of cash and patents. No problem. You pay the bill or trade patents. As Microsoft's reps acknowledged last week, there's no room in their plan for independent developers. In their vision of the software ecosystem, you have to get a job working at a BigCo if you want to make software."/>
					<outline text="The possibilities for abuse are fantastic. Microsoft may send a bill to UserLand, but not to Blogger, perhaps because I say things about them here that they don't like, and Evan sticks to lighter themes. Or I might get a bill in the mail, refuse to pay it, and every time I criticize them they up the ante legally. It wouldn't take too long before the cost of criticizing Microsoft was too high, and there goes free speech. All it takes is one BigCo to spoil the whole thing. "/>
					<outline text="Of course the USPTO should never have allowed patenting of software, it's too close to patenting speech, and that's the first sacred freedom guaranteed by the US Constitution. I think ultimately that's how we'll get rid of this problem. (BTW, in general, lawyers have been of no help on this. I've tried to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/content/index.html&quot;&gt;Lessig&lt;/a&gt; to look at this angle, but I don't think he understands how close software is to speech.)"/>

					<outline text="Tim O'Reilly pointed out that Microsoft has benefited from a lot of non-patented art that it ripped off, citing the Macintosh as an example. It's much worse than that. I designed features of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and the Windows file system browser. My lawyers suggested that we file a patent on these inventions, but I felt then as I feel now that it is unethical for a software developer to try to prevent competition that way. I let Microsoft use the ideas for free because I thought it was better for progress in the software business. (In 1985, when the outlining feature was going into Word, they didn't hide that they were studying ThinkTank and Ready. The subject of licensing the design of our user interface never came up in the discussions we had with them, and we didn't raise the issue after Word-with-outlining shipped. Same with PowerPoint, which eventually adopted many of the features of MORE. I had a meeting with Microsoft's Pete Higgins where I explained how outlining would work in spreadsheets. Shortly thereafter the feature appeared in Excel. Again, no problem sharing the idea, I didn't have a spreadsheet to put it into, they did, so I gave them the idea. The same free sharing of ideas happened in 1998-2000 when we worked with them on SOAP, based on prior work at both Microsoft and UserLand. Getting Microsoft on board was important. We made a significant contribution to their product strategy.)"/>
					<outline text="BTW, I asked John Montgomery of Microsoft, while SOAP was in development, to confirm that they had not filed any patents on this technology, and I got confirmation that they hadn't. The red flag was raised by Sun, in a private meeting, who claimed that they knew that Microsoft had filed patents in this area. The BigCo's play a pretty nasty game, I learned at the time."/>

				<outline text="Kodak vs Microsoft">
					<outline text="In this confusing News.Com &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-6734560.html?tag=mn_hd&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about Kodak vs Microsoft, there's one nugget. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kodak.com/&quot;&gt;Kodak&lt;/a&gt; wants to control the experience for users of Kodak digital cameras. Their business model apparently depends on being able to make money from processing photos. "/>
					<outline text="Microsoft, on the other hand, wants to offer users choice, but of course there's a catch. They make money on all the processing. Kodak says this is a tax on the Internet. It's easy to see why they think this is unfair. "/>
					<outline text="But how often will we print photos in the future, when the Web is so much more efficient and cheaper?"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="A shift in perspective">
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=EK&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;Kodak&lt;/a&gt; is now a Microsoft developer and dealing with the kinds of conundrums and steady narrowing of the playing field that we've all been dealing with. Welcome Kodak, seriously. "/>
					<outline text="But Kodak had options other developers don't. In 1996, when Apple was in play and Sun was rumored to be buying them, anyone with $4 billion in market cap could have bought Apple and created an open zig to Microsoft's constantly-closing-box zag. "/>
					<outline text="Why didn't they &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.userland.com/1996/01/26/wecoulddanceagain&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; strategically? Didn't they see this day coming? And who is thinking strategically today?"/>
					</outline>
				<outline text="What about Apple?">
					<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl&amp;d=t&quot;&gt;Today&lt;/a&gt;, Apple's market cap is about $6 billion. "/>
					<outline text="However even though we like Mac OS X, Apple's position has eroded substantially since 1996. "/>
					<outline text="Their operating system strategy is not at a stable point, and with Microsoft about to ship Windows XP, the first consumer OS that doesn't blue-screen all the time, the classic Mac OS is about to be totally nailed, and Mac OS X is too rough to be a realistic competitor to Windows XP."/>

				<outline text="Watch the video">
					<outline text="Last night I watched the video of the shoot out at the open source summit last week. I highly recommend watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://technetcast.ddj.com/tnc_play_stream.html?stream_id=592&quot;&gt;debate portion&lt;/a&gt;, it's about a half-hour, and if you think patents aren't going to be a big part of the landscape of the future of software, you owe it to yourself to hear from the Microsoft spokesperson, Craig Mundie, that you're wrong. If you believe patents are protecting little guys from the BigCo's, think again. Please, to the O'Reilly people, let's get the transcript of this discussion on the Web asap."/>
					<outline text="In the Q&amp;A section, Mundie said you can always challenge a patent in court. A developer in the audience said that costs a lot of money. Mundie said &quot;Get your money.&quot; Great, so it's about money and lawyers now. When you hear Microsoft talk about innovation, complaining about judges running the software industry, remember that. I had not heard this line of reasoning before. I thought there were some levels that Microsoft would not stoop to. Apparently there was room to go even lower."/>
					<outline text="Three people made outstanding contributions on that panel. Brian Behlendorf, who explained clearly why &quot;shared source&quot; isn't much help; Mitchell Baker from Mozilla, who eloquently said that one huge company is a bad ecosystem; and Tim O'Reilly who spoke on behalf of independent developers who just want to create cool software. "/>
					<outline text="I sent an &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptingnews.userland.com/stories/storyReader$1301&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; this morning to the participants in the Open Source Summit process."/>
