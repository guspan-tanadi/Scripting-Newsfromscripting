These are not potato chips. People think of twitter as a home for baby squirrels, this was clever marketing in the beginning, but now it's where the political and cultural world is centered. The former president of the United States was banned from twitter. The potato chip people need to let that sink in. It's a place where real communication happens. The better the tools, imho, the better it works. ",
