The pipes also contribute minerals to the water, esp when the pressure drops to zero as it did the other day when the pump failed. And again when the power went out. When the water comes gushing back after an outage, it dislodges little bits of crap from the walls of the pipe that were loosened when the support of the water suddenly disappeared. There are filters that catch the chunks large enough to cause problems in some of the devices hooked up to the water supply. But not all, some have no filters, and the bits get lodged in bad places, but then given enough time, they disintegrate and things slowly return to normal. I learned all this in the last few days. :boom:",
