When will it be over? Depends on a lot of things, including many that are completely out of anyone's control, and unknowable. All we're doing basically is going with hunches, and trying to see what works. The virus our vaccines were tested against is not the same virus that's out there today. Variants and mutations make the virus a moving target. We need better monitoring, hopefully the Biden Administration is working on that. 15 minutes. ",

We were not prepared for this pandemic, but we could invent, test and manufacture a vaccine, and we are able to distribute it. We're good at this stuff. And we're big and rich enough to do it right. If the pandemic had happened with Biden as president, we'd have cleaned up the virus by now, and also gotten started of ridding ourselves of the insurance industry, which does nothing for us, and takes so much.
