So when are you going to stop worrying about that and realize that the rest of us have been totally provoked. They don't worry about provoking us. Maybe that's something we have to fix.",

It was very mean-spirited, and Andrew was part of it. I find what the Cuomos did utterly abhorrent, but you know what, we still need people who can lead. Perfection is nice, if you can afford it. We can't. ",

I loved my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Cohen\">first editor</a>, she made an effort to understand my topic and me, and always made my writing better. If I disagreed she listened. Then I got a new editor, who did none of that. I read a piece with my name on it that was the opposite of what I had written. I felt like I had to write a letter to the editor saying the author (me) was an ignorant fool. It happened again, then I quit and returned to blogging where I often make mistakes, but they were my mistakes.",
