            "text": "An idea re Andrew Cuomo. Do a full investigation. Invite all accusers to come forward. The allegations are published by a 9/11-style commission. Then have an election, let the voters decide. I explained in some detail how I feel about this situation in a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/03/02/theCuomoProblem.m4a\">podcast</a> I recorded yesterday. Summary: No I don't think Cuomo deserves our mercy, I think <i>we</i> deserve it. He led us very well during the darkest days of the pandemic, and for all we know even darker days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, although <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972952844/texas-and-mississippi-to-lift-covid-19-mask-mandates-and-business-capacity-limit\">some</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/02/us/texas-governor-mask-mandate/index.html\">states</a> are acting as if we are. The very things that make Cuomo such an asshole may also make him a great leader in times of trouble. In this way it's totally parallel to the Al Franken cancellation. Also I suggest his daughters, whom we've heard a lot about (too much, although his critiques of their boyfriends were funny, I guess, you may have to be from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens\">Queens</a> to get the humor), have a talk with him. Sit him down and make him listen. Dad we can possibly save your ass if you listen now. I'm guessing they know how unacceptable his <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/statement-governor-andrew-m-cuomo-209\">non-apology apology</a> is. But ultimately this is not a decision for the press, or for other politicians, it's for the voters of New York to make. I think that in all but the most egregious emergencies, that's the right answer.  ",

I don't know, but re-reading the post, I was able to feel the relief today that I felt last year. One of the many wonders of having a blog.

They had a two-sided discussion of the filibuster. One side for getting rid of it, and the the other for preserving it. The latter was argued by a establishment Republican <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessAnderson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">conservative</a> from the <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/\">Heritage Foundation</a>. I kept thinking, they aren't the other side any longer. They represent possibly 10 percent of the Republican Party which represents maybe 40 percent of the electorate. The real \"others\" are the nutjobs and fascists. They want to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efHCdKb5UWc\">burn the whole thing</a> down. I doubt if they have anything specific to say about the filibuster. I'd love to hear a debate between the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Klein\">Ezra Klein</a> faction (smart, thoughtful, polite) and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy\">guy</a> who runs the US Postal Service or Josh Hawley.
