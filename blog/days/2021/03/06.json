I know of one person who has adapted it for his own use, that's it. The software still is far from as good as it could be. It needs the one feature my old outliner in Frontier had, scriptability. I need to get outside the limits of the JavaScript environment in the browser and on the server, while relying on the software I've built so far, to define a new <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/19/suspensionOfDisbeliefAppli.html\">virtuality</a> that is perfectly scriptable. To exist at a higher level, both as a writer and a developer. I've been to the top of this mountain before, but this time I'm taking a different path to the top. And maybe it isn't even the same mountain. That's what makes these writing/software explorations so interesing, and risky. :boom:",

So it's in all our interests to reduce the number of infections, to slow mutations. Does this make sense? Somewhere in my education, I don't remember where, they taught me to think like this. Two or more processes that interact happening at the same time. It's reality. We're in a contest with the virus. It won for many months, and it's still winning, but now we have a strategy for slowing its growth. We will not eliminate it. These are basic facts most people haven't begun to absorb. ",
