Obviously Frum, a Republican, passionately believes in the rule of law, and he is staying a Republican, he says so clearly. I read Frum's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XKVQ2MJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">latest book</a>, I read all his Atlantic columns. I cringe when he talks about Republican campaigns he worked on, and his experience in the Bush II administration. How could someone so honest be so corrupt? Somehow it works for him. Who am I to question. I have a philosophy. I don't ask how you got to the party. I don't care if you took the subway, or cam in a limo or an Uber, or you walked, rode a bike, or hijacked a bus. You're at the party, that's all that matters. Let's work together to get back to a place where we can respectfully disagree, and retain our honor. I'm pretty sure Frum would agree.",

The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1363858221694398465\">consensus</a> is they are not muffins. This, believe it or not, is a practical question. I was at the grocery store, loading up the conveyer belt for checking out. I dropped a pack of English Muffins on the belt, and accidentally dropped the other on the floor. I said \"there are two packs of muffins, please run that through twice.\" When I finished she said she didn't see any muffins. I laughed, and pointed to the <i>English</i> muffins. We had a nice discussion about whether or not they really are muffins. I thought I should ask my Twitter followers and Scripting News readers. We are mostly in agreement. ðŸ‘Ž",
