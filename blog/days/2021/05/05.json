I think that's about all the work I'm going to do on this project for now. The <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader\">GitHub repo</a> will update periodically with more images. I've shared the source for the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/app\">Node app</a> that gathers the images and data about the images, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/client\">web app</a> that displays the art in a web browser. There's a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scripting/artDownloader/main/data/art.json\">public JSON file</a>, part of the repo, that is a list of all the images, so you can create your own apps if you like. There is a <a href=\"http://this.how/artshow/\">howto</a> doc. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader#the-fan-feeds\">fans</a> who curate these wonderful art feeds. I love it, and am glad to be able to do a small part to make the art more useful. If you have questions or comments, please open an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/issues/new\">issue</a> on the repo. ",

That's the chicken that's waiting for the egg, etc. It's possible that Twitter can make the difference, the same way the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2011/11/07/martinLeavesTheTimes.html\">NYT made the difference for RSS</a> in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html\">2002</a>. That's what gives life to a standard. An entity so central to an economy, like NYT was to news in 2002, getting behind an independently developed format or protocol. With RSS it was an instant hit. It would be better imho if the NYT had bought Scroll and put its subscription function behind it. Would have also made sense for the Washington Post to do it, esp with Bezos as the owner. No question Amazon would know how to monetize this so as to eliminate the stifling ideas of paywalls and subscriptions. But Twitter is what we got. There was a <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/a-better-way-to-publish-and-read-on-twitter.html\">post</a> from them yesterday that spelled out the vision. I wish them, and us, lots of luck, because the current economic system for news is untenable. Maybe Twitter can make the difference.",
