There was a surprise, he didn't watch the NBA bubble last year. I didn't either. It was too sad. The NBA now, finally, is back. And having the Knicks do so well this year, and it being the immediate post-pandemic season, it's like both happened at the same time and one was the cause and the other was the effect, though it's impossible to say which is which. I would like to hear <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Lee\">Spike Lee</a> ramble about the Knicks, for an hour or so, or really as long as he wants. ",
