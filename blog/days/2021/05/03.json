I now have my app running and downloading images from the initial 26 accounts. I've uploaded the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/tree/main/data/images\">first batch of images</a> to a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader\">GitHub repository</a>. I plan to update them as long as there's interest in this project. I've also included the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/blob/main/app/artdownloader.js\">source code</a>, with <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader#running-the-app\">instructions</a>, in case you want to run it yourself. I'm sure there will be problems that need fixing, if you spot anything, post an <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/artDownloader/issues\">issue</a> in the repo for the app. I love this, it started as a warm-up project, but quickly got a life of its own.
