I have said that much <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/05/27.html#a105240\">here</a>, and I'm glad it looks the same from his point of view. It's <i>good</i> that two developers in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/05/23/134949.html?title=toolsForThought\">Tools For Thought</a> market want their products to <a href=\"http://this.how/standards/index.opml#1497798753000\">interop</a>. Much better than the alternative, where everyone retreats to their own silos. Why should I have to learn another editor to be part of your world? What about all the docs I already have, do you really want me to retype them? Isn't that why we have computers and networks? So this is good. A first step. ",

That's really the most important thing. It's the <a href=\"http://this.how/standards/index.opml#1497798753000\">first item</a> in my Rules for Standards-Makers faq. So if they proceed with Markdown as the basis for interop, I hope at least one of them doesn't stop there, and we can build on the capabilities of outliners and add-ons that already interop based on OPML. I think ultimately more will be possible with OPML, and I'm happy that they're working for interop. ",
