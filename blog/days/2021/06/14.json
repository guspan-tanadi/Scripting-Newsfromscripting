Over the last few days I've been tweeting and blogging like a fool about <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines#simple-use-case\">why</a> importing and exporting outlines from one app to another isn't enough. We can do much better. In the background I was working on a <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines\">new toolkit</a> for developers who want to be part of a network of outline producer and consumer apps based on [[OPML]] and [[web sockets]]. With <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/instantOutlines/blob/main/demo/code.js\">source code</a> of course, and a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/code/instantoutlinesrepo/demo/\">demo app</a> to prove it works. All my outliners support the feature as well, it's the basis for sharing outlines. This is my vision for an open ecosystem based on outlining. It's a big part of what I <a href=\"http://scripting.com/dwiner/outlinersProgramming.html\">dreamt</a> of when I started UserLand in 1988. ",

The writing is awful, and the various plots are ridiculous, though Debra Winger is pretty great. It's a very simple concept, they must've gotten bored with it (?) and tried to turn it into some kind of mysterious love affair between patient and doctor and then doctor-as-patient. Also too many patients have miraculous turn-arounds, and it's not clear why. They seem to be charmed by Paul, but we know Paul ain't charming! Oy. I'm slogging through season 3 knowing there's a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/in-treatment-review-hbo-season-4-uzo-aduba.html\">new season</a> already in progress, with a new shrink played by a familiar actor, and I want to watch it so I don't want to skip anything.

And Trump isn't done with us yet. He's the weird case of a former president who hasn't relinquished power. He hasn't learned how to use it yet, but he'll get more effective in his new role. ",
