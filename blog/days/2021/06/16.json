Every subscriber, they say, can share up to 10 articles per month that don't count toward the number of free articles non-subscribers can read. I thought I was giving this a try earlier when I clicked the gift icon, but looking at the link it generated, there's nothing special about it. I'll try again. They don't say on the site when this feature was added, I just heard about it today. A quick news search turned up nothing. ",

Trump tried to use the DOJ as if it were his personal lawyer. He didn't accept the results of the election. Had no respect for democracy. We saw and heard the speech he made to the people who would go on to invade the Capitol, there's the smoking gun folks. You can stop looking for it. We keep letting Trump slide, and it keeps getting worse. Unless journalism decides it's time to start asking the obvious question, we're going to stay stuck. The question, on the off chance it <i>isn't</i> obvious is this -- when are you going to make Trump pay for his crimes against the country? Tax evasion is cute, we want to see him pay for trying to overthrow the government. ",
