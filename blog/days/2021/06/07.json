I don't know if Biden understands why he was elected.",

I was in love with a beautiful young woman. I was a beautiful young man. I had so many friends. We all went swimming. I had a key to the computer lab at the university. I would go swimming every day. Sometimes in the lap pool out by the Ag School. Other times at a flooded rock quarry outside town. We went to the farmer's market on Sundays up by the Capitol. Fish fry on Friday night at Crandall's. This was life at its best. I had everything. I'm not doing too bad these days, and I have the memory of swimming in love, health and creativity when I was young. Nothing better than that.  ",
