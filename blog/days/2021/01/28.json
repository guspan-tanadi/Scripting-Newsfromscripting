Previously they were the fascist party that ran the country with no checks. Now they're the minority party. And if the Democrats have the guts to nuke the filibuster they can add a couple of new states that are likely to vote Democratic, adding four members to the Senate. That should help a bit. And they can fund the recovery through reconciliation even if they aren't willing or able to get rid of the filibuster. ",

Moody <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/top-10-john-lennon-beatles-songs/\">songs</a>. Norweigian Wood, In My Life, Strawberry Fields. He's had an actor's face, a poet too. A prankster. Paul McCartney was just the commercial guy. Penny Lane, Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, Rocky Racoon, Mother Nature's Son, The Fool on the Hill. All the <a href=\"https://ultimateclassicrock.com/paul-mccartney-beatles-songs/\">ones</a> you love to sing along with. Let It Be and Hey Jude. As I've gotten older, I still listen to the Beatles, it's been a life-long constant, and I've come to appreciate McCartney more and more. As he sings, there's nothing at all wrong with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzNpso_vDaQ\">silly love songs</a>.",
