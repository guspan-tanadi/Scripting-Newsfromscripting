The original Nazis came with a lot of stuff the new ones don't. They had uniforms, a symbol, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Nazi_Germany\">flag</a>, a leader and his manifesto. The new Nazis don't have any of that. In Germany the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_memorabilia\">paraphernalia</a> of the old Nazis are illegal. In the US that would be too offensive. There is still a memory of WW II, we remember who the enemy was then. If they walked around with swastika armbands people would know for sure they're the enemy. Maybe at some point they will decloak, but that hasn't happened yet. I thought of putting a swastika in the right margin, but felt that would be too shocking. That's the point. So there is a difference. I got emails from several readers. Thanks!",

When they call for rain in the forecast, they mean water is going to be coming out of the sky uniformly, both in terms of geography and time. If you go out when it's raining, you will get wet. However if they call for showers that means it will rain on and off, and it might be raining in one town and not in the other. It's more intermittent. You can risk it, you might not get wet if you don't bring an umbrella. ",

I think I paid $3300 new. Those were the days. It was a very reliable little car. I called it the Lawn Mower because that's about how powerful the engine was (slight exaggeration). Back in those days, the mid-70s, the <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/interstate/history.cfm\">Interstate Highway System</a> wasn't finished, and I drove it all around the country, and a lot of it was on two-lane highways with heavy truck traffic. My poor little lawn mower (with me inside!) would get blown around a lot. But it was very reliable. Only broke down once, and that was due to operator error. I ended up trading it in for a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/01/25/voyager.png\">hippie van</a>, a high mileage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsqWuR9JI54\">1974 Plymouth Voyager</a>, which I also drove all over the country. The van ended up dead in a ditch in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemeketa_Park,_California\">Chemaketa Park, California</a>, a little community I lived in off <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/CA-17,+California/Comanche+Trail,+Lexington+Hills,+CA+95033/@37.1575867,-121.9911122,15z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37e7e8678013:0x54ed81a461ad50b9!2m2!1d-121.9879274!2d37.1479208!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e37c36d2bf239:0x11177495e7605172!2m2!1d-121.9794407!2d37.1614182!3e0!5i1\">Highway 17</a> between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz.
