I feel lucky to have been vaccinated, but am confused about where we are now, and the future is still hard to have a feel for, or to even have a theory of. At least we have solid management on a national level, and that will help everyone, everywhere. The US never forgot how to be the US, even though we had an insane clown-like president for four years. The vaccine is here now, and more are on the way. And I know enough math to understand that the benefit of the vaccine starts as soon as one person is vaccinated. The more people who are immune, the slower the spread of the virus, complicated by its mutations which give it new power to evade. We're running a race now. At least we're <i>in</i> the race now. That's something. But think of all the unnecessary suffering and death we're leaving behind. Today, it has a more substantial meaning to me than it did just a couple of days ago. ",

In the meantime, I solved the problem with the crappy UI for the LG screen I bought <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2020/12/14/173714.html?title=myNewTv\">last month</a>. I bought the top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08Q34DRLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Roku device</a>, plugged it in, and it gives the same great picture, and lets me control everything from the much more <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2019/04/17/144031.html\">elegant Roku remote</a>. I loaded on all the apps I need, including Fubo, which is not available for the LG, and after a few hours I realized why the Roku remote is so superior. There are so few buttons, and they're big enough, that I don't have to look at the remote to operate the UI. This is important for a TV where you use it in a dark room, ideally. Roku is the best. People say it's dated, I think it's really that it works, and that's what I want. ;-)",

People have no idea how the bits do their dance to make the things happen on the screen. So if we talk about politics or media, well there can't be much there. They won't look into that box. Interestingly, it seems our supposed ignorance also extends to how the computers work. They always have to get an expert who if they ever wrote software hasn't done so for 20 years. If this theory is true, can you imagine how much damage this ignore-ance is doing?",

So if your house has increased in value, you have to give the government money. Even if you didnâ€™t sell it. There is no rule that you have to pay for the relief btw. The government prints money. There is no inflation, kind of the opposite pressure on the economy, weâ€™re in a depression. Part of the reason for relief is to stimulate the economy. So a wealth tax could cause a stock market crash, Iâ€™m sure economic advisers would warn the president. All those rich people selling stock to pay the trillions in tax. Maybe we should tax people who write stupid op-ed in the NY Times instead. ðŸ¤ª",
