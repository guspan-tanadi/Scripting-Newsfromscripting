I'm getting incredible support from the Drummer users. This is the kind thing you have nightmare dreams about, a deployed product where you missed a serious problem in development and have to scramble to deal with. We still have some serious problems to deal with, but I think it's mostly possible to avoid them, and I'm confident we will get them fixed. I want to get to work on some new features, I really miss that. ",

Drummer blogs are unique in that there are archive pages for each day, and month. Which is a date problem other blogging tools don't have. I was trying to think how we solved the problem in Manila and Radio, and then realized we didn't have the problem. Drummer is different. Which is kind of what you'd expect from a product with that name. :smile:",
