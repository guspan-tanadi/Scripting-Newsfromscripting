            "text": "The name of the scripting language in Drummer is Drumkit. I have reserved a <a href=\"http://drumkit.org/\">domain</a> for it. There's nothing there at this time but a placeholder. <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/\">Gary Teter</a> came up with the name in a <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/PostMonsterG/2021/10/30/060526.html?title=moreDrummerThingsIpadEdition\">blog post</a>. When I read the post, I was pretty sure this was the name. I love how it connects to the name of the product, and it conveys the utility of having a language in a product such as Drummer. It also reflects the duality of the product. You can beat the drum in Drummer by writing, if you're a poet, and if you're a plumber, there's Drumkit. It's also nice because it leaves open the option of the language existing outside of Drummer, but no one will miss that the language <i>came from</i> Drummer. That's important I've found. I left similar clues in RSS and in podcasting. I think naming a product is a community thing, the best names don't come from one person's mind. Gary understands a lot about what I'm trying to do with the language, how else could he have devised such a perfect name. He can be proud, much as <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html\">Dannie Gregoire</a> can be proud of coming up with the name we eventually used for what we were calling audio blogging, even though there's a British journalist who falsely claims to have coined the term. Already the Drummer community has made a great contribution to Drummer. Many thanks! ü•Å",

It isn't Facebook, that's just a diversion. Most people are falling for it. The problem is that the news system is sick. We talk about inequality in terms of how much money people have, but what about inequality in terms of the information they have access to. I pay for better news that poorer people can. But even with that I'm still  impoverished. News people are lazy. I can't believe they weren't all trying to get a real ticktock of Trump on January 6, starting on January 7 (give them a few hours to get over the shock). But I hear from the Washington Post that they thought they had an innovative idea to look into this in October! Holy shit. Is that what they think news is. Oy we are so lost. ",

We should know a lot more by now. And this was happening all through the Trump presidency. The news was resetting expectations constantly, noting that Trump wasn't a normal president over and over.
