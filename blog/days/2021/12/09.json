I consider it authoritative but seriously flawed. There is no way to get lies removed from the record. I've seen people insert themselves into stories they played no part in. I've never had an edit stick, even for mundane events like a traffic accident on the MacArthur Freeway in California that I happened to witness. But it's the best we have. ",
