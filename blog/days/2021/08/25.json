This is wrong. He's doing the job we hired him to do. Our mistake is we give up our power and responsibility and look to a parent figure to take care of us. But that's not how America works.

We should judge the president on their honor and intelligence, and ability to listen, and we should take responsibility for <i>our</i> power.",
