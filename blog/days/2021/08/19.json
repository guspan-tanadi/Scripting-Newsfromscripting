You couldn't write in one place and have your writing flow to all of them, the way podcasting works today. They don't agree on what a post is, so no matter what, you'd have to write at least two or three versions of a post. In the end, you just blow them all off, because it isn't worth the trouble and the resulting format is taking the fun out of your thinking and writing process. You aren't getting anything out of it. Not money, not exploration of ideas, not getting other people excited.",
