Later I started at Episode 1. I don't know how many times I've watched <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-wire\">The Wire</a>. I'm almost at a point where I can recite the lines along with the actors. I've yet to see a flaw in this show, there's nothing I don't follow with rapt attention. I can't believe there are people who haven't seen it. It's as I imagine Shakespeare was in his day.",

It's a very simple idea. A table that associates terms with text. If I use one of the terms in my writing, when it's published, the term is replaced with the text. We use \"OPML\" to represent the glossaries. Here's my <a href=\"http://drummer.scripting.com/davewiner/glossary.opml\">personal glossary</a>. I wish every place I type text could be configured to use my glossary, so where ever I go I can use my terms. It would also be great to configure my searches to use these terms too, so Google for example would know what I am referring to when I type the name of one of my own products. ",
