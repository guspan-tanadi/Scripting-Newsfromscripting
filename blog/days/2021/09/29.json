The source of the failure was a very small module known as <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dateformat\">dateformat</a> that had updated, which is fine, maybe they have bugs. So I went to their <a href=\"https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases\">repo</a>, and saw a reference to a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2021/09/29/breakingChange.png\">breaking change</a>, which sounded like it might be the thing that broke my app (not well documented imho), and I found a <a href=\"https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat/releases/tag/v4.5.1\">version</a> before the breaking change, released on Jan 30, and updated the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog/blob/master/package.json\">package.json</a> for the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/oldSchoolBlog\">app</a> at the beginning of this tale to require the earlier version, rebuilt it, and it worked.

As far as I can tell the feature had nothing to do with its mission, formatting dates. What they were saying is I should accept their change and upgrade to the version of Node they require.  if I were to do that, I'd have to shut down the server, upgrade Node, and then test all of the apps running on the server to see whether the new version of Node broke them, which imho is much more likely than dateformat breaking them.
