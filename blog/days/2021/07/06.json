I agree. I have made dreams of mine come true several times before, so I know it can happen. You have to think clearly, be willing to change your mind, work very hard, and persist. We're almost there again with outliners. The web was designed to be organized by outliners. Very few people know this, but the ones who do, are very excited. I'm one of them. :boom:",

There's a new explosion of interest in outliners, so now is a great time to start wiring these things together to create truly world wide applications. We're on the cusp of greatness, again. Imho, ymmv, mmlm. :rocket:",
