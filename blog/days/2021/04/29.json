Or she might have been confused. She died at 66, my first grandparent to go, when I was a grad student in Madison. I used to stay at her <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@40.5735367,-73.863431,3a,75y,49.15h,87.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sH90kfd-HjSqxwYfJBxsdGQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192\">house</a> in Rockaway when my parents traveled.

Her brother, my great uncle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt\">Arno Schmidt</a>, is a famous German novelist, in intellectual circles. When I tell people from Germany that I'm related to Arno Schmidt, they either look at me like I'm an idiot (Schmidt is a common name in Germany!) or the they are impressed. I inherited a lot from her, for better or worse. :rocket:",
