Their product transformed under [%search: Trump%], and now that he is gone, or so it seems, knock wood -- what's left for them to cover? Here's what I suggest. This requires that you put the heat on Biden and Judge Garland. First I've heard it said that January 6 could happen again, which I think is too meek. It <i>will</i> happen again. And until the prosecutions begin, the news should be filling in the details the same way they were covering every detail of the Trump crime scene when he was in office. Who are the leaders? Their names, pictures, backgrounds, are they free, awaiting trial, on the run? These people, and the politicians that are covering for them, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-senators-voted-against-bipartisan-bill-anti-asian-hate-crimes-2021-4#sen-tom-cotton-of-arkansas-1\">six sentators</a> who voted against the Asian hate crimes bill, to name a few, are vying for the position of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/03/06/howToPreventAnotherTrump.html\">The Next Hitler</a> of the United States.

On the whole this is a better deal. More variety, it's more personal, much less repetitive, and besides the Knicks are playing entertaining basketball, and that's more than I can say for whatever sport they're playing on MSNBC. ",
