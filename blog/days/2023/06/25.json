There are at least two URLs you can use to access the RSS 2.0 spec on the Harvard website. When I looked up the one with the apparent problem, it was one they only started tracking in 2016? I don't know. <a href=\"https://staging.bsky.app/profile/at.kyefox.com\">Kye Fox</a> on Bluesky <a href=\"https://staging.bsky.app/profile/at.kyefox.com/post/3jyxlk4hgn72x\">found</a> an archive of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030801072832/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss\">the spec</a> that is available on archive.org starting on July 22, 2003. Here's the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/07.html\">archive</a> for this blog for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2003/07.html\">July 2003</a> (the actual page, not on archive.org). This is <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss\">the URL</a> we were using at that time. It hadn't been moved to cyber.law.harvard.edu yet. So we have found a snapshot of the spec from 2003. And it was my mistake, not archive.org's. The <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/06/20/224546.html\">statement</a> that it had been at the same address for all 20+ years was not true. I am sorry for my mistake, and thanks to archive.org for doing such a good job of maintaining the record of this document and all the rest that they do. :smile:",
