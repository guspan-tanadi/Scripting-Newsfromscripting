The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin\">Banshees</a> movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts but it was so painful to watch, not much room for laughter. And I guess I didn't really watch the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabelmans\">Fableman</a> movie, walked out after the opening scene. Spielberg's movies have declined into self-obsession. He thinks we're so freaking stupid and he's so freaking wonderful. Come on man do another <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)\">Jaws</a>. Now <i>that</i> was a movie. One thing I got from Banshees is that the Irish say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feck\">fecking</a> and I wonder if it means what I think it means. Anyway, I'm looking for something great to watch, and have fallen back to re-watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)\">Band of Brothers</a>. It's been so long since I last watched it that it seems pretty fresh. I long for that kind of story-telling, but they don't seem to make shows like that these days.",
