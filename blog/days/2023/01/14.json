It took a lot of iterating to get the right version of the OS running on the machine and to then restore a Time Machine backup on the machine without having one or more extra accounts on the machine. One thing I will never understand is why Macs are so slow at transferring stuff over a local wifi network. All the advice on the net says you need to use faster wifi, but my wifi is very fast. Here are <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/14/speedtestresults.png\">speed test results</a> communicating with a server in NYC, about 100 miles away. Why is it so much faster to communicate with that server than it is to communicate with a laptop that's in the same building? ",

In the past when new markets appeared, like the personal computer, desktop publishing, the web -- there were always publications that grew up along with the platform, because there's such demand to know about the latest developments. I contacted my friend <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/109682144184951137\">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who teaches journalism at CUNY to ask if there was interest in one of their students forming a news site to gather news of the Mastodon world. He liked the idea and now they've taken the next step. They're offering a full scholarship to their \"100-day, online certificate program that helps creators establish their own enterprises to serve specific communities/markets.\" Apply by Feb 3 <a href=\"https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/entrepreneurial-journalism-creators-program/\">here</a>.
