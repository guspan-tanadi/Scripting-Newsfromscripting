Well if it stops raining, summer, which is usually the best time of year here, and pretty much anywhere. It's why I live here. But this summer. Well the only thing that could be worse imho is if we had this much precipitation in winter. Well, I know that isn't actually true. The heat wave in the west sounds pretty awful.
