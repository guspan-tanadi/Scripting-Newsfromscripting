There are hundreds of thousands of us, maybe tens of them. They're having trouble keeping the system running. As I dig in more on Bluesky, not because I'm getting married to the platform, btw -- more friends reach out and ask for help getting an invite code. It isn't about Bluesky though, it's just that we got <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2023/06/03/233657.html\">the feeds up</a> there first, so there's a way I can build. Ultimately my goal is to build a layer on top of all the social nets I can, so it doesn't matter which service you use, the stuff I create can make it to you and will. I used to write about \"when a big tree falls it creates room for new growth.\" I wrote that about Jerry Garcia. And it's equally true about Twitter. As they vacate, and get smaller and more focused, I believe understandably, the places they vacate once again become interesting places to develop. I can't miss an opportunities like these. ",
