I thought to use a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api\">toolkit</a> John Spurlock pointed me to. But where to start? All the theory upfront, like the spec, I just want something that takes the ID of a post and returns a JavaScript object with a bunch of info like the text, any image enclosed, when it was posted, stuff like that. There really are only 5 or 10 endpoints most apps need. If you're interested in solving this problem for Bluesky, please post a note in the <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/266\">thread</a>. ",

The only news here is that someone in government is finally trying to really do something about it, or at least that’s what it kind of looks like. We’ve been here many times only to find out at some point they decide for some reason he’s right and the laws don’t actually apply to him, and so far they haven’t. ",
