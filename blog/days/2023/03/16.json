As part of the transition, and please this is only for people who read Scripting News, so don't pass it on -- membership in <a href=\"https://feedland.org/\">feedland.org</a> is now open. It had been closed since Dec 12 when I started working on the transition. You only need an email address to sign up, not a Twitter identity.",
