The easiest fix is to edit bookmark so it goes to <a href=\"https://feedland.org/\">https://feedland.org/</a> -- note the <i>https.</i> Another fix is to do a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html\">hard-reload</a> of the page. This will force a new version to reload. It redirects if it gets a non https request. ",

But as a software developer, I can experiment with the product with that caveat, and imagine its uses once the quality of the results are better, however they achieve that. I don't have to wait to think, in other words. With that disclaimer, I searched for docs about how to do a hard-reload in popular browsers. Those docs are hard to find, and when you find one it's heavily monetized. So instead, I asked ChatGPT to write a <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/03/19/new-chat.html\">docs page</a> to answer this question. Looks pretty good to me! No bullshit in the page either. ",
