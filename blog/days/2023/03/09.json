I have the <a href=\"http://this.how/standards/\">original</a>. Well a bunch of people copied my file and posted it on their sites, with their template and their ads (I don't have ads), and for whatever reason Google ranks their docs higher. Mine isn't even on the first page. So tell me, how is that Google isn't implementing a \"man in the middle\" attack? Why aren't they taking the heat for delivering incorrect results?",

It's amazing we're trained not to see the lies that Google passes off as facts, but somehow we're supposed to hold the startup accountable instead.",
