An <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/03/28/whoInventedRss.png?nodialog\">example</a>, I asked who invented RSS? Can you imagine how much Iâ€™ve written about RSS in 20+ years? The first part is boilerplate, could have come from any site, but the second part was a very concise, thorough and interesting synopsis of years of <i>my writing</i> about feeds. The chatbot did very good work. ",
