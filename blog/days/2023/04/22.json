Let's hope they stick with the current plan, and add new players who can <i>start</i> great careers with the Nets, instead of pointless veterans who have already won championships and have no reason to keep playing to win, and dis the fans of NYC, first by telling us the Knicks suck permanently, then claiming it's okay to be a Nazi and still play basketball in NYC. We like our basketball players to have a reason to want to win, who don't feel they're doing anyone a favor by showing up to play the freaking game, and don't practice race-hate on Twitter. New York is a diverse city, and proud of it. Welcoming the Nets back to NYC. No more carpetbaggers please. And <i>definitely</i> no more Brooklyn Nets/Nazis. Thanks. ",
