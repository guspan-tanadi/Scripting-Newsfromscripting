Maybe in the next round we'll be able to create something that isn't owned by the tech cartel, (neither Twitter or Facebook is owned by anyone who appears to give a damn about it), that has the same kind of vibrancy that Twitter once had. Sure it could've been better, I wish Jack and Ev had been more supportive of developers, but I definitely miss what it used to be, flawed as it was.I'm really tired of all the bad-mouthing of Twitter on Mastodon. You all are missing something important, Twitter wasn't  just about who owns it, they're really not that important, it's about the people who use it. <i>It's always been that way. </i>",

I still need the code. So I tried asking ChatGPT for help here, and it had a number of suggestions. I implemented the one they suggested that didn't require using a package other than HTTP. I adapted it but am getting a <i>400 Bad Request</i> response from WordPress. I'm going to keep trying to massage the code. I feel like I'm really close. (I got my <a href=\"https://concordtest.wordpress.com/2023/04/23/this-is-a-test-5/\">hello world</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/wordpressHelloWorld/blob/main/wordpresshelloworld.js\">code</a> to work. This is a big deal. I didn't end up using the ChatGPT code, instead I used an NPM package that was suggested three years ago, and for whatever reason I didn't get it done then. It was the first response in the thread.)",
