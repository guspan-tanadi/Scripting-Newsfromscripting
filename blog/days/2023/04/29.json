But it looks like Shiv and probably Tom are going to run ATN, and we know Shiv wants <a href=\"http://scripting.com/publicfolder/chatgpt/2023/04/29/moderate-candidate-not-specified.html\">someone else</a>. And also don't forget, the oft-overlooked Roy, <a href=\"https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Connor_Roy\">Connor</a>, is running for president. It might not matter who's Logan's successor, the show might be about who is the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SuccessionTV/comments/si0qg8/who_is_the_raisin_based_upon/\">The Raisin's</a> successor. It's hard to imagine the Swede cares, but we know for a fact that Shiv does. And in this, she's not like a Roy kid, she's a <i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZTaXjt2Ggk\">serious</a></i> person, who's been kept on the sideline too long because of her gender. A Roy might end up in the White House, a new <a href=\"https://www.distractify.com/p/who-is-the-raisin-in-succession\">raisin</a>, and whoever it is will be in Shiv's pocket? <i>That</i> would be a fine ending.
