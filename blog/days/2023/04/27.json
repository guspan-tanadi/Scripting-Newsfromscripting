Also last night, equally surprising, the #8 seed Miami Heat <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36300795/jimmy-butler-heat-stun-bucks-ot-oust-top-seeded-milwaukee\">eliminated</a> the #1 seed Milwaukee Bucks.

That's where I'm going to be for sure (watching on TV of course). And to think it wasn't that long ago that Knicks fans were wearing <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/23/knicksPaperBags.png\">paper bags</a> over our heads. The Knicks are now the team I always hoped they would be. It all paid off. And thanks to <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/08/kevin-durant-new-york-knicks-are-not-cool-anymore/\">KD</a> for putting the positive jinx on the Knicks. ",

People seem so scared of having the machine alter our writing, but for me, it would be a service. I never am able to sit down and turn this stuff into a book, I just don't write that way. Maybe I could team up with a bot who would be the perfect editor. ",
