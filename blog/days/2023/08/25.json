It's the longest trip I've taken in the Tesla, and this time, unlike my trips to NYC, I had to use the Supercharger network. I am too exhausted to write up the experience, but I learned a lot, and for the first time I let the car do the driving, with careful supervision. It's a kind of letting-go, I'm a terrible passenger, always prefer to drive. But this was fun, interesting, and gave me new respect for the technology I've been working on pretty much my whole life.
