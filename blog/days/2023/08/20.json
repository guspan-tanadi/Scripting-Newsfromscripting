Here's an example, Matt Haughey's <a href=\"http://xoxo.zone/@mathowie.rss\">feed</a> on Mastodon, as <a href=\"https://feedland.org/?river=http%3A%2F%2Fxoxo.zone%2F%40mathowie.rss\">viewed in FeedLand</a>. These posts, as you <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/08/20/titlelessPostsInFeedland.png\">can see</a>, have no titles. So we bold-up the first sentence, or if it's too long, a big part of it. They look different from titled posts, but now that we've lived with this for a few weeks, I think it works. Might still do some tweaks. ",
