Finally, we've gotten around to insisting that this question be answered. And a jury of Americans will make this decision. How perfectly American.",

When trusted, we do an amazing job. And whether most of American culture treats individuals like mindless blobs, the justice system is built on trust in the wisdom of the people, who once so challenged, don't let us down. ",

I want to get more systematic in working on FeedLand. When you're reading a docs page, there's a command in the menu that opens the same page in GitHub. If you're a FeedLand user, you may want to read the new docs, it's always a good idea I find to review the docs of products I use. You often see things you didn't pick up on the first time around. ",
