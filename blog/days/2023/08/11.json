The problem is somehow related to his persistent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service\">Secret Service</a> protection, and I guess they figure his detail doesn't want to go to jail with him. Okay so get some new agents, possibly recruited from existing prison guards. They can keep him safe, no doubt about that -- if anything it would be easier to do so in prison. Give him his own prison in a remote wilderness, perhaps in a nice blue state.",

So I'm using the <a href=\"https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/07/01/orangeBlob.png\">orange splat</a> image in place of any likeness of Trump himself. I see him as a <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/medical-magazines/human-scourge\">human scourge</a>. Punishment for us for lacking honor or integrity, humanity. There will of course be a final post about Trump, someday, but sadly we are not there yet. ",
