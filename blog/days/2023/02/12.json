You can scan from top to bottom and see who updated, and by clicking on the wedge next to feed, you can see the five most recent posts. It's a new kind of feed reader. You can see how it works by <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?username=davewiner\">clicking this link</a>. That's my feed list. You can view anyone's list. For example here's <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?username=ScottHansonDE\">Scott Hanson's list</a>. You want to see a list of who has lists? <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?userslist\">No problem</a>. All this without logging in. Unprecedented, goes far beyond feed readers. It's a group feed management system. Unprecedented. New ground. Soon you'll be able to run your own server. It's getting close. ",
