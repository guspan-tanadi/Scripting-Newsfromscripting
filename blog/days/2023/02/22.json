And the addresses of the blogs have changed too. Sorry, but we did a big migration there, you can see the role identity plays in online work. We were depending on a private company that became <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=elon+musk+on+the+twitter+api\">wobbly</a>, so that's what caused the breakage. The foundations we build on on the 2023 web basically suck. Sorry I wish it weren't so.",

Not a guarantee I never will, but in practice, I don't want to know who's tuned in and who isn't. I don't ask personal friends to subscribe because they might choose not to, and that's not something I want to try to parse. Everyone's free to do as they want, and to not know what the choice was, unless the other party wants to make it known. Complicated? Yes, and still evolving. ",
