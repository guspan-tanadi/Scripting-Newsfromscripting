I've loaded it <a href=\"http://feedland.org/?river=https%3A%2F%2Ftradesecrets.archive.podnews.net%2Findex.xml\">into FeedLand</a>. And James loaded it into <a href=\"https://web.podfriend.com/podcast/trade-secrets4\">Podfriend</a>. It's great to have this stuff resurrected in a form that people interested in the formation of podcasting, journalists and historians we hope, can learn from. Thanks James! I hope he does the same with my <a href=\"http://morningcoffeenotes.com/\">Morning Coffee Notes</a> podcast, which precedes Trade Secrets, and documents developments in the summer of 2004. ",

It's okay, it is what it is. I went into it with my eyes open, I knew there could be a day when we had to quickly get out of TwitterVille. :smile:",
