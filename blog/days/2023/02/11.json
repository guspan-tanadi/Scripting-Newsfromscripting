I was writing a post for the Caddy repo, asking for help, when I noticed it was working. I changed absolutely nothing. Didn't reboot anything, or change any configuration settings. So now we're much closer to being able to redirect to the new site and let the users start checking it out for real. ",

Luckily, the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a> wasn't as powerful as Apple or Google, and their format didn't replace \"RSS\". But, imho, when you push an open tech and someone takes you up on it, you should help, not fight them, ie if you really meant it.",
