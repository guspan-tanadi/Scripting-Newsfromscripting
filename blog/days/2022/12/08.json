I know people don't like Tesla these days, but I still feel like it's a privilege to drive my Model Y every time, even though I've been driving it for over a year now. It's a feeling of able-ness no car has ever given me. And that's the feeling my new eyes give me. I've been dis-abled seriously for years now. And my vision never really worked, even when I was a kid. I remember getting glasses for teh first time in second or third grade. I never knew there was so much writing in the world, everywhere. It's like that except at an age where such discoveries are pretty rare. I think this experience will fade away as my new eyesight becomes the norm, but for now, it's given me a new youth-like experience, pretty cool.",

It isn't terrible, but it's imho wrong. The first item has a [no title] message where a title would go. Why? Look at it from the human reader point of view. What information does that convey, above what the writer was saying, in bigger type and in bold. <b>NO TITLE</b>. I don't know about you but to me that looks like criticism, an error message, from the software to the person who wrote the post. Sometimes all the posts show up with that message. This time only one did. And for the others, they repeat the first bits of the post. Again, why? The human read them once, why put the same words they just read on the screen again?
