Apparently a lot of people on Masto didn't know about it and the response has been resounding. And the numbers are very lopsided. The piece has been \"boosted\" (the Masto equiv of RT) 1.1K times, yet I only have 3.7K followers there. Meanwhile on Twitter, where I have 69K followers, it has been RTd just 17 times. My feeling was previously that Mastodon was more alive, it's good to have a number to put behind that. ",

Everyone, including me, is smitten by this invention. I asked it to <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/03/trumpstory.png?nodialog\">write a story</a> about Donald Trump admitting he is a troll and tells everyone to just ignore him, and it'll be good for everyone including him.
