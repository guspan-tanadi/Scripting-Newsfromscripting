I am reluctant to promote it until it's had been validated. So if you know how to run a Node app, and have a few minutes to help out, please give it a try, and let me know, <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/feedToMasto/issues/1\">in this thread</a>, whether it worked. A link to one of the Mastodon messages it created would be helpful too. <i>Thanks!</i> ",

I asked the OpenAI chatbot to write a story about the demise of bloggers now that OpenAI can do all the writing. It added journalists all on its own. I assume some pundit can use this in an op-ed for the NYT or Washington Post about the dangers of AI. Which I then asked OpenAI <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/12/02/oped.png\">to write</a>. :boom:",
