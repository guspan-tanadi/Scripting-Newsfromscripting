I started writing, and couldn't keep up with my mind, so I opened up my iPhone and started talking about what happened and what we should and shouldn't do if we want to rebuild the war-torn landscape of blogging and feeds, that still exists. I addressed this to <a href=\"https://braddelong.substack.com/p/old-style-blogging-should-be-new\">Brad DeLong</a> one of the earliest bloggers, and a user, not a developer, as in \"users and developers party together.\" We can still have it all, imho -- but we need users to work with the developers. It's 15 minutes. ",
