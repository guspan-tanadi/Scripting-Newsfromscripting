I'm not listening to them in any particular order. I felt kind of bad about it, but I got over it. One idea he talks about was there was an idea of white drugs and black drugs. I can vouch for that. I was blown away a few years ago to find out <i>everyone</i> smokes weed. I thought it was just a white boomer thing. Everyone does it. The sound of eyes opening. I asked Alexa to play me some Hendrix music. First she played Hey Joe which I'd been bingeing on. Then came his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TgbWOy6Buk\">opening</a> at Woodstock. And then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLV4_xaYynY\">All Along the Watchtower</a>. It was really emotional for me. It's already been a heavy duty emotional day. Let's go deeper! After that he asks <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZHGJxv3qQ\">Are You Experienced?</a> Hey for such a young man, he <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix#Death,_post-mortem,_and_burial\">died</a> at 27, he was very self-aware and surroundings-aware.

Another interesting weirdness, as I've been working on software this week I can now see that I have been mis-spelling the names of things all over the place. I have a practice of copying and pasting names when I want to refer to a value or call a function, so as the mis-spellings propagate, my code still runs without errors. I really have been transformed into an able-eyed person in just one little operation. My dreams, also amazingly, have become more vivid and memorable and also gratifying (no more information forthcoming in re this). I think perhaps when one's vision improves it improves in many dimensions. Did I mention that the screens in my life reveal details heretofore unappreciated! The retina display I'm typing this into has many subtleties. Amazing. ",
