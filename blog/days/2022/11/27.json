And we've got users to play with. <i>\"Users and developers party together.\"</i>",

Computers used to be like this. In the 80s you could use any writing tool you wanted and any printer. There was no concept of a writing tool that was bound to a printer. We're very close to that now, closer than we've been in a decade. I am determined that we do not pass up this opportunity. Seize the moment. ",
