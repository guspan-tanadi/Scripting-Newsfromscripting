I want to do everything I do with Twitter for Mastodon. I don't have the ability to do this myself, for quite some time -- I'm the only person working on FeedLand and there's still a lot more to do. The package is MIT licensed, so anyone can do this work, and I don't need all the functionality. Looking for someone to take on this project. ",
