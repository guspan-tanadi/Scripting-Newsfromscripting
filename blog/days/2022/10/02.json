Could be the IBM PC with calls to the <a href=\"https://www.pcjs.org/software/pcx86/dev/rom/ibm/5150/\">ROM BIOS</a> to read files, or the Apple II hardware screen <a href=\"http://www.applelogic.org/files/AIIETECHREF2.pdf\">memory</a> (invented by the clever genius Steve Wozniak), or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_event\">Apple Events</a> supported by various Mac apps in the 90s, or the <a href=\"http://xmlrpc.com/\">XML-RPC</a> interfaces for web apps, or the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+interfaces+of+GitHub+and+Slack\">REST interfaces</a> of GitHub and Slack or thousands of other services. They give you an API, and then after you see what it can do, and if you want to use it in your app, you write some glue, so all your calls flow through code you control, so if you learn something about their API, you only have to support it in one place. It's especially important for the few services that reserve the right to break their developers. Apple used to do this all the time, I haven't programmed to an Apple API in a very long time. Maybe they stopped? It's a way of forcing your developers to redeclare <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJbsXeRc_Fw\">fealty</a> to the Great Platform every so often. I like the web where no one has the power to break me (although <a href=\"http://this.how/googleAndHttp/\">Google</a> might argue with that). ",

GitHub has a rule that you can only have one call extant at a time. This is a terrible for for an environment like JavaScript that doesn't let you do that easily. I got tired of managing that stuff in my application code so I added the queue to <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/github\">davegithub</a> and that simplifies all future applications that have to write to GitHub. Absolutely nothing revolutionary in that -- it's just nice to be able to forget about that particular feature of GitHub, let the software manage it for me.
