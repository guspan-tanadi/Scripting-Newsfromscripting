Warning what would happen if a Republican bought Twitter. Has anyone heard Musk say he's trying to protect American democracy? A realist would have to say at this point that American democracy is not a good bet. I think it's pretty much already gone folks. Musk has opened his channel with Putin, and the two are going to exchange favors. Musk is in a stronger position than Trump was, probably even when Trump was president. He has all this money Trump never had. And now he has a platform more powerful than all the newspapers in the world. ",

I see why they might be doing it, but I didn't quit Twitter when Trump took it over, and his tweets were impossible to avoid. But people are doing it, and that gets me interested in the idea of a brain-dead simple to use and simple to host way of pushing messages into the ether so friends can easily and quickly catch them. Nothing more than that and of course an API, also minimal, for peering. ",
