People have raised huge amounts of money to redo the development projects I already did, hired all kinds of product managers, marketing people, and most of them failed, I think because none of them understood what they were working on, or didn't have the skills necessary to move forward, so they just re-did stuff in a different way. If I called something \"item\" they called it \"object\" -- each of the elements got new names but did the same things. None of the investment went into  actual new development, moving forward. ",

The two products need each other, they hook into each other. It'll be fantastic. But too few people will use it, if the past is a predictor. To the extent other people use it, I won't hear about it, so none of their experience is filtered back into the product. ",

Because the reality is you <i>can't</i> make a fortune here, it's a one in a million shot, but everyone is still trying. Meanwhile everything goes to shit, everywhere you look!",

Only I wouldn't cast myself in that role, because when I wake up in the morning I want to keep pushing forward on my development projects. I thought when the VCs were interested in RSS we were talking about me doing the development. Nope, they hired their own programmers, thinking that what I was doing was menial, fungible, or was finished somehow or their guys would know what to do next. My friend Adam Curry started a company, raised huge money, and like the others, thought that he could save some money by replacing me with other programmers. I'm sure the programmers told them they could do it. Something must not have worked. (Sorry that was sarcasm.)",
