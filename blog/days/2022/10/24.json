It's not like any other feed reader that you've seen -- in fact it's very useful in conjunction <i>with</i> feed readers, thanks to the OPML subscription list standard. ",

It's for support only. If you're stuck, can't figure out how to do something, or something appears to be not working. But please read the home page first, before posting. It's a small community, all volunteers, so use the resource carefully. And absolutely no speeches, or even feature suggestions. You can use the open web for all that. After all this time, we're not naive about how to keep peace in these groups, it's by having absolutely no tolerance for abuse. ",
