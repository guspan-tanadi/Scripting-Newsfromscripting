            "text": "Funny thing happened watching the Mets game last night, which I had a bad feeling about right from the beginning. When they finally lost, I slammed my left hand on the arm of the chair in a reflexive move. The watch which was also on the hand started shrieking wanting confirmation that I had taken a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208944\">hard fall</a>. Presumably it was going to try to get me help if I did. I answered no. It asked if I fell at all. I thought for a second and said no. But I did have to think about it. The Mets have always been heartbreakers. As a fan since 1962, there have been lots of downs, but the ups are spectacular. We keep hoping for another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmjuuQQX3Z4\">1969</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llHnR0ZPy6E\">1986</a>. The day will come, that's the feeling. Will this be the year? Well, if it is, it's going to be a long slog with lots of heartbreak on the way. ðŸ˜¢",

I don't know. But they could try to be charitable and welcome people less fortunate than themselves. That instinct is in them too. Has to be, we're all human. And stop the self-pity, it's bullshit. You think you're teaching northeasterners about immigration. Hah. That's laughable. All of us of us are immigrants! You are too. Freaks.",
