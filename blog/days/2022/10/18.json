It forces the publication to include all the info a reader might reasonably expect from a story. So often you read a story and you think you're going to find out (for example) what station the show is on, or where the concert is, but they leave out the one crucial bit of info. Often it's probably not deliberate, they just don't think in terms of an actual human being reading -- actually wanting to <i>use</i> the information you expect to be in their article. By having a rigid checklist of things every story must cover, they are making a promise to a reader, that Semafor won't omit crucial information, that they are thinking of the reader. ",
