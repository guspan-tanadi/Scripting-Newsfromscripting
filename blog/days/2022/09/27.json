If you look at a Twitter url, there's a screenname in there. So how do you find the name of the person who posted tweet whose id is 1574769537244958720. Turns out you don't have to. Make up a name like <i>mamamia, </i>and form the url like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mamamia/status/1574769537244958720\">this</a>. It'll find the tweet for you and redirect to the actual users screen name. Nice little hack. ",

Feedly might be too much for a new feed user. And Substack comes with a lot of news sources already programmed in. If I were in charge of Feedly, I'd do a \"lite\" product that's free, does everything Substack's reader does, includes all the Substack feeds. And of course the upgrade to the full Feedly would be easy. Substack is going down the same path we went down with Radio UserLand in <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2002/01/11.html\">2002</a>. It does both reading and writing. That's a big deal.",
