I never go for these things, but I did this time. I was wearing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07M6TWDLZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">biking shorts</a>, the kind with padding so you don't get a sore butt. So I wasn't actually wearing underwear. I had sushi for lunch. The combination: human sushi.

It's amazing to me, because it's the flipside of what I've been wanting to do for years -- develop software for writers and thinkers without trapping them into a tech industry business model. Today the software is inexpensive to make and operate. That isn't the problem, we know how to make the software, the problem is attracting a critical mass of users.",

I can't convince them on my own. I'm not famous enough, trusted enough, or whatever. When I do it, it doesn't happen.",
