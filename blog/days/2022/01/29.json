It goes quite a bit deeper than just the financial tricks that inflated the bubble. What's so depressing that we not only didn't wake up from what we were doing and start to fix it, we've drifted further into the morass. It's hard to believe the United States has any foundation left. And the world is on the verge of telling us to fuck off, bigtime. I think that's what Putin is trying to provoke now. Show the world we don't have the will to defend a country that obviously deserves our protection. ",

It's their answer to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S92QBCJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1\">Logitech MX</a>, which I also have. I love the MX, it has a very nice feel and most important the keys are backlit. I like working in a dark room, so it's important for me to be able to see the keys, esp as my eyesight weakens as I get older. I got the new keyboard because I was unable to switch the <a href=\"http://daytona.scripting.com/?q=Ctrl%20and%20Cmd&collection=scriptingnews\">Ctrl and Cmd</a> keys, so I could also use Windows and Linux on the same machine without breaking my brain. For some reason when I do the switch using the Control Panel or Karabiner, the mapping doesn't stick. I thought maybe the problem was with the keyboard, so it was worth $50 to find out. Sadly there's something wrong with the computer, this new keyboard has the same problem. If you have any ideas on what might be going wrong, or what I might try next, please send me a tweet or an email. In the meantime, I also got a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072M4YLN6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1\">new mouse</a>, an upgrade from the cheap-feeling Microsoft mouse I got because I decided to try using a scroll wheel mouse and liked it.

Nothing can prepare you for it. I've known quite a few people who dealt with this in tech and know very few who were happy about it. Before you're rich and famous you think it'll all be great, but once you're in it, it just spins you around and you struggle to try to stay human, but if your fame gets big enough everyone wants to own you, some even tell you to your face they want to own you, but they don't need <i>you</i> if you get what I mean. I have walked away from the adventure a couple of times myself. But learning about the Beatles, and I still have a lot to learn, has opened my eyes wider than anything, because before this investigation started, all I knew about the Beatles was the one that the public owns.
