The advertising says it's up to us, but it's actually the companies running the ads that have the ability to reverse the destruction. It's all about programming our minds to come to the incorrect conclusion, the one that keeps us focused on ourselves as individuals. The one place we could change things is with our votes. That could have immediate impact. So it's not without hope, you just have to stop believing journalists about the inevitability of the Repubs regaining power later this year. It is not inevitable. ",
