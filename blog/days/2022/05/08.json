I'm trading my Model 3 for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y\">Model Y</a> this week. The Y's were hard to get when I decided it was time to get a Tesla. The way values have been going, I'm paying very little to make this switch for cars of comparable value. The mileage on the 3 is low. And the cars are still very much in demand, it's a seller's market. I want the Y because I am tall, and getting in and out of the 3 is a pain. The Y, which has a different seating arrangement, is easier. ",

I know no one there will latch onto it, because it's not the kind of thing Twitter-the-network pays any attention to. Which is the point. The only way to get something like that going is to go first, the same way podcasting and RSS and blogging before it got started. Do it until it seems obvious, and then there's a FOMO, and let the people with the loudest voices pretend they were there at the beginning. All those things have to happen. So we're a long way from being able to work together, but until we start, we'll still be mired, and the people who think and act long-term will keep running everything.  ",
