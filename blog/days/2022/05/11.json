I haven't seen him in a few years, and at this time in our respective lives people's appearances can change dramatically. He looked good but old, like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=colonel+sanders\">Colonel Sanders</a>. I think he got a stylist and I'm guessing the Colonel Sanders look is deliberate? I'm sure he'll tell me. Anyway <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/05/11/nerd.png\">the nerd</a> is going on and on, and if that really is Doc, I can't imagine he knows what he's talking about, and why the hell should he. The guy was talking very fast about problems that I thought would have been solved long ago. This is 2022 after all. I guess that's just nature of computer stuff, we're always re-inventing things. I do it too. ",

The app would run in a web page or on a server (if so, must be a Node app). It takes a <i>url</i> parameter, displays the contents of the file, parsed and indented consistently, and uses the same display that <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/rss.xml\">GitHub uses</a> to display code, though it doesn't need any of the GH features, just the appearance. Horizontal scrolling, not wrapping text. I would use it in <a href=\"http://xmlviewer.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml\">my existing app</a>, with credit of course. I need this because my work requires me to look at XML files. And as far as I know there isn't a great way to do that, and given all the XML that's out there (web pages are XML, RSS feeds are XML) it would make sense to solve this problem well, as a very useful upgrade to the user experience of the web.
