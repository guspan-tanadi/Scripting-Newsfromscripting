From Spotify to Tidal to Qobuz to Apple. Do a comparison — all shit.\" I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1529431623774752768\">wrote</a> in response: \"I’m a newcomer to music apps, but got a free six months with Amazon Music, and it works pretty well, just wish I had more control over offline mode because where I live there’s no cell coverage. Haven’t tried the others.\" Here's what I want in case anyone knows how to do it. They have a station that just plays music they think I'll like. And after six months, they have a pretty good idea, and the stuff they recommend often is stuff I really want to hear.  I want to tell it to download a couple of hours of this stuff. Or maybe always have a couple of hours downloaded. So when I'm out and about, maybe on my bike or driving around, I can listen to music uninterrupted. My iPhone has huge amounts of available memory, can't think of a better use of that space than music that's just for me. I hope there's a setting for this. It could just be a checkbox. Or even better, a preference that says how much memory it can use to cache stuff. ",

Obviously it's a college textbook, because it recites facts, names and dates, ad nauseum, things that are probably required by curricula (just guessing)m., and there isn't much in the book that I didn't already know. I was expecting something that truly lived up to the title, that explained why were still living with slavery today, but that isn't what the book is about. I think it's a provocative title for a pretty ordinary American history book. My next book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson-ebook/dp/B084FLWDQG\">Caste</a> (*) and so far am getting a lot out of it. Will report. ",

I did something like this a few weeks ago with a glass of ice water. When this happens I quickly mobilize, moving everything of value away from the puddle. There were no towels nearby so I ran to the bedroom and got an old t-shirt that I could sacrifice, ran back and quickly sopped up the puddle and all the random bits of coffee and ice I could find. Now there's dried coffee on my keyboard and my mouse. But everything still seems to work. I went downstairs and made another tall glass of ice coffee, and hopefully this one will end up not on computer hardware and my desk, but rather fueling a day of creativity. This is a blog, therefore I am obligated to tell you, dear reader, about these events. ",
