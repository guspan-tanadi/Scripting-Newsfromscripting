Treat it like the right treats Sharia Law or Critical Race Theory, only of course the FS is real. And the conspiracy is real. It's how we got here. I heard Biden on the radio this morning talking about MAGA being behind this. That's not useful and it's not true. The MAGA people will really be hurt by this. Now is a good time Mr President, to try to unite us. This is the real anti-people Republican Party. The 1%. The Federalist Society. It's a plot to rob us of our rights. To turn America into a religious dictatorship. Mr President here's your chance to be transformative. But first you need to learn how to talk about it.",

Even today, after the news of the Roe v Wade decision leaked, they're saying that Repubs are expected to take control of Congress in the November election. Let's dive into that supposed fact. Who is doing this expectation? Shouldn't they say? Isn't it just reporters who expect that? Like so much news this is like barbers cutting each others' hair. They isn't any actual news. They should always be aware that anything could happen and almost always does that could change the expectation, so stop advertising your expectations, they have no value as news. ",
