            "text": "One of many things that's great about the pairing of the Celtics and Warriors in the NBA Finals is that they're not the Lakers and the Nets. Both teams grew their own talent, formed teams in an artful way and patiently developed  their players until they found the right formula and nurtured it along. I also like that they have welcomed back Al Horford and Andre Iguodala, two heros of previous Celtics and Warriors campaigns. Not only is this a good way to build a winning team, but it also feels right to the fans. I don't want my teams' geography and legacy used, as if it were an airline, meant to take a couple of superstars somewhere, to host them -- but I see, all fans really -- a family, with generations coming and going, and a continuity all the way back to the beginning. I esp like that the Celtics <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hunterfelt/2022/04/21/why-boston-celtics-fans-will-never-forgive-kyrie-irving/\">shook off</a> one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger\">carpetbaggers</a> on their way to the Finals. The Knicks are my team, but I can appreciate other teams, learn from them, imagine what it would be like to be a Warriors or Celtics fan, and appreciate basketball well-done, which I hope to see in the Finals which start on Thursday.
