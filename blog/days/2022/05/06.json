But inbetween ventings, it's a place to be heard, maybe just a little. And if you listen carefully you might find out about something new. I first heard of the leaked Supreme Court opinion on Monday on Twitter, a few minutes before I heard about it on MSNBC (I was watching Chris Hayes at the time). By the time Maddow was on I had fully read the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473\">Politico article</a>.
