I was looking for a snapshot of the \"What is a weblog\" page. A lot of work went into defining what it meant, because there was some confusion about this in the 2003 blogosphere. And then it turns out the page in question is <a href=\"http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">still there</a> on the Harvard site. Good thing it was preserved. And in case that page ever disappears, it's <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160729162359/http://blogs.harvard.edu/whatmakesaweblogaweblog.html\">also on archive.org</a>.",

It's also weird that watching shows where people use the word casually and often, your mind starts saying the word in your head, and it's not impossible that it could make it out of your mouth. In that case it doesn't mean you're a bad person, just that you watch HBO or Netflix. I think there's a good chance that's what happened when <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/03/531365550/bill-maher-apologizes-after-using-n-word-on-his-show\">Bill Maher</a> said the word.
