I feel strongly that packages that want to tie things together should be written in straight JS, that's why I chose that as my development platform many years ago. Actually I'd prefer if we stuck to the JS we were using in 2013. :boom:",

I get to return the phone when it is delivered. That's like saying you get the prize when you win the prize. Right now my job is to wait and hope, according to Apple. Here's the thing -- if the phone were to ever actually arrive I would keep it. I wanted to buy it for a reason. But Apple doesn't have a button their customer service people can press when they understand that the company's system is torturing a customer and to escalate it to someone who can give the person their money back and maybe a nice present to indicate that they are somehow valued. There is no such button. And btw, Apple says the phone is \"out for delivery\" and <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/08/upsScreen.png\">UPS says what they said yesterday</a>, basically we can't find the phone in our system because of COVID or bad weather, which translates to \"we left the phone somewhere where it could be stolen.\" Of course if it arrives I will let you know. üçø",
