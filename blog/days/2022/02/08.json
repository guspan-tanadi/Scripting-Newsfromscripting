My goal always was to work with other people. I'm not kidding. I wanted to be part of the Beatles of software. But, what generally would happen was that people wanted to take over my projects and work on them, without me. It has happened over and over. An unmistakeable pattern. Every time I heard about it, I was really puzzled. Some of the people were software developers who should understand that when you get someone's source code you're getting a very small thing, relative to understanding all the decisions that went into it. If you take over the project you don't know any of that. And when it has happened, for example at UserLand, I knew there was trouble when one of the developers complained that there was too much code to figure out how it worked. He couldn't understand why there was so much of it! This was a guy who had shipped real products. Why would he be surprised by this? Doesn't he understand that it takes a lot of code to create something simple and consistent, so the human mind can deal with it. I have thought about his comment for years. And why didn't he call and ask me to walk him through it. I was alive, I would have taken his call and I would have helped because it would have been an example of that elusive \"working together\" thing that I've been searching for. ",

That took a couple of days to sort out, and lots of time on the phone track down their system error -- somehow my credit card number was replaced on their server with someone else's number. Pretty disturbing considering Apple is a <i>computer</i> company. So that delayed them sending the replacement for the lost or stolen phone. Too bad for Dave because that was when we had good weather. It turned bad again, with power outages, and networks down, and now the second phone is caught in the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/02/08/upsScreen.png\">UPS system</a>, and who knows when I'll actually get the phone. Thinking about asking for my money ($1300) back and buying the same phone at Amazon. Maybe their luck will be better. Both companies screwed up here, and neither of them has been willing to assign someone to fix the problem, and ignore what the computer tells them to do and get the phone to the customer already. I'm not at the North Pole. I have a car, the roads are clear, but it's looking like they lost this phone too. ",
