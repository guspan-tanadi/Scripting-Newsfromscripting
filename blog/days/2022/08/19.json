Now he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alfranken/status/1560430185375305728\">says</a> it was a joke. I almost forwarded it as evidence of how depraved Trump is, but it really was proof of what an idiot Franken is. A self-destructive idiot, who was it seems on his way back, but he should just go away quietly and never be heard from again. A punchline to a joke -- remember what it was like to elect a \"comedian\" to Congress.",

Suggestion to browser devs: treat viewing a feed as lifting the hood on a car or viewing the source of an HTML page. When you do that, you don't see another car interior, or another rendering of the HTML. You see a lot of technical stuff.
