Accredited and graded, which gets the student's attention. First thing I'd teach is how to write a report on software, whether it be a bug, or an idea for improvement.

Is this something I could do for myself. If I got the feature would I be able to use it or am I just thinking of something would be nice to have, perhaps for others. Everyone feels they would know how to design software, but if they could get close enough to it to see how it actually works, they would see that there's actually a lot to it.  ",
