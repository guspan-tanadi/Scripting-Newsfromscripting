It's a fancy word that means that people went around the intermediaries. So travel agents which used to be a big thing, were replaced with Expedia and Kayak. We got information about real estate from Zillow. And the sources of reporters got blogs, and then Twitter accounts, and started going directly to the users of news. Of course there still are travel agents, and when I bought a house recently I used an agent to help me, but I did a lot of researching myself on Zillow. And there are still reporters, of course, and they use the tools that sources use, that's how they get the information they pass on to their readers. We're much better informed these days about lots of things. Some info we get through intermediaries and some we get directly.",
