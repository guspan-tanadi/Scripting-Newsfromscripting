All your files are in an <a href=\"http://opml.org/\">open format</a> which can be read by most outliners. You can easily and quickly download all your files with a <a href=\"http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/general.opml#1634478289000\">single command</a>. You should do it frequently. If you want Drummer to keep going, help out next time there are new features, get involved in testing. Anyone can do it. It should be possible for me to introduce a new fix or feature and find out if there are any problems within a few hours. That's what the process needs from users, at least to be somewhat viable going forward. ",
