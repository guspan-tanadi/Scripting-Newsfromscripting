It was as big an event in 1970 as Elon Musk tweeting that he wanted to acquire Twitter in 2022. The album amounted to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)#Press_release_and_the_Beatles'_break-up\">announcement</a> that the Beatles were broken up. In fact, Lennon had already quit the group, but hadn't announced it publicly. But it's a <i>good</i> album. I listened the hell out of it when I was a teen and in my 20s, but never really <i>listened</i> to it if you know what I mean. Like try <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCppWWmIGQ\">this song</a> out. Or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XB2STqyKY\">this</a>. So much to listen to. And he did the album, in secret, and on really low tech hardware with no mixing board. Just four tracks straight to tape. Much more lightly produced than Beatles songs, no grand George Martin productions, just McCartney and that's worth something.",

It's like <a href=\"https://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a>. And Second Life was boring. All kinds of people said it was the next big thing, but they were people who generally didn't correctly spot big tech things. But there are life simulations that did catch on. I loved <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity\">SimCity</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims\">The Sims</a>. Poured endless hours into them. The difference is that they are third person and Second Life was first person. In The Sims you get to play god. It must not be a lot of fun for the <a href=\"http://scripting.com/images/2022/04/22/sims.png\">virtual people</a> in The Sims, but it sure is fun to play god. Maybe Zuck should check that out.

That's where the <i>virtual</i> in virtual reality is fun, when you get to be Elon Musk and own your own Twitter for example. Isn't that the dream we all had as kids, that we'd grow up and then we'd show them. I used to have images of my father, locked in a tiny bathroom, with a bowl of spaghetti poured on his head. I would say to him \"You're staying in there until you learn some manners, young man!\" It was a nice dream then, truthfully it still is. :smile:",

New Jersey just opened yesterday, and I was interested in seeing how prices compare to those in Massachusetts. Too early to draw any conclusions.
