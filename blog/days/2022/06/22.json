I wasn't signing up for another stint as notetaker for this particularly community. It was too thankless a job. But guess what, not much happened. The RSS people are using today is pretty much what they were using 20 years ago. There have been some new applications, and there are some respectful projects to add a new namespaces. That's more or less what the roadmap called for. So without any leadership, it kind of took care of itself.",
