My mother on the other hand was a NBB or <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html\">Natural-Born-Blogger</a>. She always had something on her mind and had to tell the world about it. So of course I, their first-born child, wrote outlining and blogging software, all together in one package. My mother once said that I was a good investment. She thought that way too. My father if you can believe it, said every day is Father's Day, thanks to my outliner. ",
