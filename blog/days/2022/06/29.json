A block away was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School\">DeWitt Clinton High School</a> which was all-boys and definitely had a football team. We were under no illusions about who would win if we fought, so they didn't pick on us. Sort of an honor thing, I guess. Anyway we called ourselves (and as far as I know still do) The Science Fa**ots. Maybe they <i>don't</i> say it these days, this was before political correctness. :smile:",
