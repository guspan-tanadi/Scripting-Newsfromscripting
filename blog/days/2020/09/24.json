It's okay if a slogan translates into a concrete promise, but it doesn't have to. Obama had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">Yes We Can</a>. That's pretty good, hard to refute and doesn't really commit to anything in particular.

And once you erroneously hit the Back button the Forward button doesn't work either. The place you were at is lost. This is pretty bad for software that's ten years old, and the bug persists even in the new version, suggesting it's a deep flaw in the design, or worse, it's intentional.",
