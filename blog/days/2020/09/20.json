I've inundated the car with peppermint and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bounce-Fabric-Softener-Sheets-Outdoor/dp/B003FULBQ4\">Bounce sheets</a>. Parking it outside, not in the carport. I think the mice like the carport even without a car. I also bought a couple of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C5DECBBE-4F56-4C36-B933-E62144578691?tag=meastus-20&gclid=CjwKCAjw-5v7BRAmEiwAJ3DpuOsz49iXrSiSpBb72lentx8D88xp2hcCYLD-BK_KD06oQO_kDldVdBoCn5UQAvD_BwE\">Blink</a> cameras for the house. I figured that I should put one of the cameras at ground level next to the car, and see if any mice show up in the dark of night. So far one rodent, not particularly interested in the car. Here's the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3t5AfNKyk\">video</a>. I love using spying hardware in the War Against Mice. ",

It's so frustrating when smart people quote the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablum\">pablum</a> they hear on the cable news shows. Those are bedtime stories. The world is far more dangerous and far less predictable. Go back and watch the shows from a year ago to see how well they did.",
