And the answer is <a href=\"https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037465992-How-do-I-export-my-email-or-subscriber-list-\">yes</a>, you can export your subscriber list as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values\">CSV</a> file. So I wonder why people would stay with Substack after they get a certain amount of income. They get 10% for doing something that doesn't cost very much. If they're making say $1000 a year off your mail list, why not take distribution in-house? That's a straight question. I want to understand how the business works. Thanks.  ",
