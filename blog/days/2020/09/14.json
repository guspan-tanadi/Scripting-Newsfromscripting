The names offered were some of the famous ones, and I felt the same frustration I felt back in the day when the style sections of pubs like the NYT <i>made</i> those bloggers famous, and ignored the ones who weren't as young, but had deep experience in something other than blogging. The story always was here come the bloggers, look at how weird and stupid, in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs\">Microserfs</a> way, they are. If they looked a little deeper and more optimistically, they'd discover that their sources were going direct, and now they can do a different less superficial kind of journalism. That would have been powerful, instead we got the fearful story. Over and over. Blogging is and always will be [%search: sources go direct%] to me. I want to know what you know.
