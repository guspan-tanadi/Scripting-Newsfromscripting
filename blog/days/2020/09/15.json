I talk about the Daily podcast and Brian Lehrer, two formats that work. Why has the tech for listening to podcasts evolved so slowly? Who has the ability to innovate? Same with blogging. When was the last time there was a serious innovation?",

            "text": "Trump always talks about how other countries don't pay us for the things we do for them, but they do, they really do. Hugely. The US has the world's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency\">reserve currency</a>. We're the only country that can print money that can be spent anywhere. People all around the world use our currency to store value. Even with all the lunacy, our dollar is still the safest place to store value. It means we can always have more money. We don't even have to actually print it, they're just numbers in a spreadsheet somewhere. Trump, of course is doing everything he can to make everyone else <i>not</i> trust us.  So if the trance breaks, and the dollar is no longer seen as the most trustworthy country, we would end up being one of the \"other\" countries, and we'll have to pay <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#Chinese_yuan\">China</a> to store our money, along with all the other schmucks. And they'll have the power we still have. It's one of those things that if you don't know about it, and most people don't, you can't understand how global economics works. And when they say \"The American taxpayer paid for this,\" well it's not technically true. ",

The format is basically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_West_Wing\">The West Wing</a> in Denmark. The prime minister is a woman with a family. Every episode, as in TWW, they tackle a big issue. It's in Europe, and it's a small country, not the mighty USA. It's very well done. It's slow going because they wrote it so that you need to read things in the show and read the sub-titles (the characters get information from reading headlines in newspapers that go by too quickly to read them).  Sometimes they drop into English because the characters would speak English then. It's on Netflix now. There are already three seasons and a <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2020-04-29/borgen-season-4-netflix/\">fourth</a> is on the way. A side-note, the chief of staff of the PM is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilou_Asb%C3%A6k\">Pilou Asb√¶k</a>, who played <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters#Euron_Greyjoy\">Euron Greyjoy</a> in Game of Thrones.",
