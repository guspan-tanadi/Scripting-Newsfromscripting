Oh well. It was a reallllly expensive phone, around $1500 if I recall correctly. The new iPhone SE is even nicer and was only $350. And I also love the Pixel 4a. I can't decide which is nicer. But what is great is both Apple and Google are now making inexpensive phones with formerly high-end features. If you're using an old phone, even one that's only two years old as I was, it's worth looking at the new Google and Apple offerings. ",

I had the car fumigated, but sadly, the stench is as bad as ever. I'm going to find out what I can get for the car in trade, and move on. A <i>very</i> expensive lesson. On the other hand, I asked my fellow Woodstockers how they deal with mice and cars, and I have learned so much. I'm going to make a list of all the ways people keep the mouse damage to a minimum, and I'm going to practice it. I was very lax, liberal, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire\">laissez-faire</a> even with the local mouse community. No more. I am on the warpath. It's them or me! :boom: ",

We are forced to go to indoor centers, until we all get the virus, so the economy can reopen fully.\" I'm sure Trump unchained would try to bring his version of Hitler to the US, with serious advantages. Hitler didn't have nukes, America's wealth or an ally like \"Covid-19\". He can and I'm sure will do a lot of damage. I think people should be confronted with that very specific vision, in all states, red and blue. ",
