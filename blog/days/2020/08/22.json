The population of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=population+wyoming\">Wyoming</a> is 579K. The population one of the boroughs of NYC, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=population+queens+ny\">Queens</a>, is 2.3 million. So if 15 percent of the people in Queens relocated to Wyoming, that could yield three more non-fascist Electoral College votes, one member of the House and two Senators. ",

It was his moment. Trump is the reaction because there were a lot of Americans who felt tremendous fear and resentment in having a young sassy (they'd probably say uppity) black man as president, no matter that he brought the economy back from the wreck that the Repubs left us. Remember how they drove it into a ditch. ",

Not sure what the women's equivalent of uppity is, but it's a real thing. And because she was my candidate, I felt it, felt it in a way I had never felt it before. I was enraged by it.

There were plenty of times when I didn't have any idea how I was going to pay the bills. They never had that concern. They could break me, I couldn't break them. They had all the power. They resented that the VPs at Apple would take my calls or respond to my emails, and those emails would be circulated with notes like \"Please do something about this,\" which of course resulted in nothing happening other than more resentment. The bosses didn't listen to them, but then again, they didn't listen to the bosses either. They really held the keys, the top people at Apple had no clue about how computers worked, so they were at the mercy of the people in the room who expressed their displeasure with me that day in the 1980s.
