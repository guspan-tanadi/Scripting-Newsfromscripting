After 40 years of being part of online groups, I see there are no new tricks in the human species, these things always evolve the same way. That's what this podcast is about. Might be a chapter in a book someday. ",

All kinds of things freak them out but the one that they can't live with is equality for \"others.\" Strips their gears. Not negotiable. They'll <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mluckovichajc/status/1298027757990010881/photo/1\">tear the country down</a> before they let that happen. As long as all they have to do is vote.
