Imagine if Melo had been LeBron's sidekick. At least he's found a happy home now, and that's cool.",

I asked my lead investor what to make of it. Should we not ship our Apple product and port to the IBM PC? He asked what Apple's sales were. About a billion dollars. He said you can safely continue, companies with a billion dollars in sales don't disappear. He was right, of course. A year later they shipped the first Mac, and we were on board for the boom in 1986. Had we switched in 1983, we would have missed the boom, and been lost in the crowd of second-tier PC companies. On the Mac we had a chance to rise to the top, and we did.",
