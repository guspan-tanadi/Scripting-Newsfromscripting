He has advice about organizing, something he knows about, has had enormous success with. I actually read his <a href=\"https://nader.org/2020/07/31/ralph-nader-letter-to-aoc/\">letter</a>, which is something I expect most of his critics didn't, because if they did, they would stop and think and maybe just maybe <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=get+a+grip\">get a grip</a>. For liberals, Nader should be considered a pioneer of the stature of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis\">John Lewis</a>. He successfully <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed\">fought</a> to reform the auto industry, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Laura__Antonini/status/1294307355232894978\">so much more</a>. I bet when AOC reads Nader’s letter, she will respond because she’s the real deal, as is Nader.",
