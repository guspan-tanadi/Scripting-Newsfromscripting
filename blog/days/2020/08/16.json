Can't wait for the election. Trump's plan to steal the election <i>will work.</i> First, do not vote by mail. Do not vote by mail. Not sure what you should do if you live in a state like Utah, Washington or Oregon where vote-by-mail is all you can do. Second, Congress has to come back. We must protest in the streets. Esp in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KolbieReports/status/1294615470004469760\">DC</a>. They must feel our ire. Now, not in November. That will, for sure, be too late. ",

To take a screen shot, click the power button and the home button simultaneously. I will never remember these, but at least I will be able to find them on scripting.com. The problem with the way Apple changes this stuff, when you search for it, you find the old method. To get the new method you have to have as many followers as I do on Twitter. This is a bullshit way to run a platform, Apple. ",

These are lovely people who I speak with them frequently online, but it was so much better to eat and imbibe in person, outside, under the stars. With the animals and bugs. Ideas flowed. We made new jokes, new memes. I promised to do things that I have since forgotten. What I will never forget is how much I enjoyed their company.",
