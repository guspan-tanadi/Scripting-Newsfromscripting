I didn't realize how much I missed live sports. It's good but I think they should get rid of the fake things.  Iâ€™d like to hear what the sport is like with just the player sounds, no simulated fans.  The screens with fans supposedly reacting to the play is pointless. I remember that high school and college basketball had charm, because the fans weren't so much a part of the action. Please put the player names on their uniforms. And.. When Melo scores the announcer has to say  <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo+Annnnnnnnthony\">Carrrrrrrrrrmellllllllllllo Annnnnnnnthony</a>. Please. Also Melo must wear a white headband. How else can I find him on the court?",

Trump is exploiting that loophole. Not defending the country against the virus. It's running wild. And without help from scientists the people don't understand it. If it were a fire burning in their neighborhood everyone would understand that it must be put out. No time to waste. But people can't feel that. Evolution didn't teach us to fear a virus at a primal level. So here we are. We have these great communication tools. What's next?",
