Dress rehearsal for Election Day. At your local polling place, you ring a bell and salute the American flag, and go home. We all take turns. Then on Election Day itself we all know where to go, and we have it in our minds. You can still vote by mail if you want, assuming you trust it. We should make Election Day as much anticipated as any holiday. It wouldn't take a long time, but it would give every local TV station a place to send their cameras. The famous suburban parents with their kids on bikes and singing. Republicans too. Everyone join in. This is America. Doc Rivers. That would make it clear to everyone what's going on. Your country needs you now. It's important. ",

He had an <a href=\"http://this.how/frontier/howFrontierGotStarted.opml\">automatic transcript</a> made. It's the story of how Frontier was developed between 1988 and 1990. I had two years to get back into fulltime programming after selling Living Videotext to Symantec. It was totally an iterative process, I didn't know where I was going to end up. Started by building components, then puzzled out how to integrate them. It's the way I've always developed, before and since. Made for an interesting but somewhat exhausting read. I had forgotten the details, for the last 30 years I've been <i>using</i> the software. It's taken us to interesting places, blogging, podcasting, XML-RPC, RSS, etc. Lots of food for thought. :boom:",
