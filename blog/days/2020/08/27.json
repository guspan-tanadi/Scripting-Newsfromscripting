But that isn't what they're saying. They're saying that Black Lives Matter not because they're more important than white lives or cop lives, which seems to be how you're interpreting it, but because a lot of black people are being killed and the justice system does not seem to care."

I suspect this has been going on all along, but now with the wide use of smartphones, we're actually seeing it, visually, as we couldn't have seen it before. Now it's not their word against a cop's. The video provides testimony that is impossible to refute."

So the first thing I would say to a black person who said Black Lives Matter is thank you for containing the rage you must feel, that I would feel if I were in your shoes, that I feel in a small way on your behalf, at the cruelty and callousness of our system and culture. Then I'd ask if there was anything I could do to help.",
