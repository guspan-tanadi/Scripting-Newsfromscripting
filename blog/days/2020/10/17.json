I’ve seen it before and read the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moneyball-Art-Winning-Unfair-Game/dp/0393324818\">book</a>, but it’s good to get a refresher. Everything, not just baseball, needs a fresh look, because we’ve been doing so much the same way we always have, without thought, not questioning out-of-date assumptions.",

The reason, in retrospect, is that sports is all about the ritual, the continutity, the historic connection. Novelty feels wrong. For example, I still haven't gotten over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter\">Designated Hitter Rule</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal\">three-point shot</a> in basketball still seems like an innovation. I like sports because they connect to the past. I went to games as a kid with ancestors who are now gone. \"What did the Mets do?\" was the beginning of every kitchen table conversation in the house I grew up in. It was the default. To this day my brain says those words when it's idle. This season was a heroic effort for both sports, esp the NBA with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble\">bubble</a>, but the only heroism that gets me to pay attention to sport is what happens on the court and on the field.
