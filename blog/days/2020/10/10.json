I just realized that Joe Biden may be <b>The Politician from Nowhere</b>. I can't think of a single issue that he's associated with. Oddly I think that's exactly what we need from a president in 2021.",

You can still read the text underneath it, but it's better if you scroll it out of the way. A blog version of a lawn sign. :boom:",

He calls it radical. It's the kind of judgment courts issue all the time. Look for ways to set things right.  Make everyone whole. The web should have remained open. Google and Facebook didn't respect that. So undo what they did. It's the way a programmer looks at things, and imho that's the right way, because it's tech we're talking about setting right. Usually they don't consult techies in these things, however. ",
