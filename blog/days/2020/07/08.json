She's going to make custom masks that have a message. That's the first part of this story. Second part, we both started a campaign called #SaveMyLife, where we promote stories and ideas that save people's lives in this age where lives have all of a sudden become cheap, something our government is promoting (the cheapness, not the saving). So Jen has designed a mask that has the #savemylife message on it, which is kind of heavy, and to balance that she put a giddy little smiley on it, to make it more Jen-like. I said I want one, but maybe I want mine to have a picture of <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2016/12/20/mlk.png\">MLK</a> instead of the smiley. And then I would probably change the tag to #blacklivesmatter. This is something that I, a white man, would wear with pride. But there's a problem. The purpose of my wearing a mask is to save <i>your</i> life, not mine, in case I'm infected and am shedding. I feel contradicitons like this have to be resolved. Or do they?",
