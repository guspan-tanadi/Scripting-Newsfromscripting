How the story of Columbus is told, how it's designed to serve a purpose, all from the perspective of Europeans. You might think, of course it is, this is the US, but a lot of the people who are taught that history are not descended primarily from Europeans. So it isn't their history. ",

That should have been topic #1 as it was happening. Moderator, ask your pundit, geez if he'll leave Puerto Rico to die, do you think he'll care whether we live or die? And then wonder what if we get hit by a calamity that isn't local, that affects the whole world. Why do they leave the tough questions on the table until it's too late. The point of the canary is to pay attention when the canary dies. When you're about to die, it's too late. It's so repetitious, they say the same things over and over, for weeks and months. Yet all the important questions, the obvious ones, go unasked. ",
