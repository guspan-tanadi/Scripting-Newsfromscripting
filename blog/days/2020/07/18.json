There's an even bigger risk. Twitter itself could be bought for 1/2 of $28 billion, the company's valuation according to the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/\">stock</a> price. That's a fraction of the net worth of a number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires#2020\">billionaires</a>. And you could probably <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout\">finance</a> the acquisition, so you would need much less than $14 billion to pull it off. Basically Twitter itself, legally, is very insecure. We're depending on something a bad actor could take over, legally. I've been writing about this for <a href=\"http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html\">years</a>. I hope other people tune into it before it actually happens.

And finally, someone is actually reading them. I bet his staff is planning on how to address each of the issues. Anyway, for now he says both Russia and China are interfering with our election and he says what you'd hope a president would say. BTW, \"meddling\" is the wrong word, meddling is what a Jewish mother does. What Russia did in 2016 was an act of war. Americans are dying because of what they did. ",

We both felt that he had been unfairly <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=woody+allen+condemned&t=hk&ia=web\">canceled</a>. And yes the word <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/woody-allen-memoir-canceled-hachette-outrage-1202216039/#!\">applies</a> to his experience. He's one of the great film makers of our time. The movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(1979_film)\">Manhattan</a> came up in our discussion, I saw it was playing on Amazon, so I watched it. What an incredible movie. People forget that Allen wrote the movie, so any flaws you see in the main character, and they sure are there, were put there <i>by him. </i>In the end you feel his heartbreak at having been so dismissive of Mariel Hemmingway's character, she was so much more wise than him, even though she was so much younger. I had forgotten that Diane Keaton was in the movie. It's a masterpiece. ",
