The US welcomed my family in the 1940s. My parents were children, their parents were running for their lives. All of our love of country is being tested, but as it is, it is revealed. It takes on new meaning. We'll come back from this. There are a lot of reasons for the trouble we're in, some habitual, some technical. I've heard Americans say they wish they had left when they could, but there's a reason we didn't leave. This is our country. We can't abandon it in its time of need. We're the ones who stayed. We will make it work.",

I just turned it off. I did a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5kRl-Qy7_I\">video demo</a> of the feature so we can remember how it worked, and if needed I can turn it back on.
