Maybe the national mask should have an American flag on one side and #BLM on the other. Redefine unity as including all Americans. And let's win this together. Love America. All of America.",

Very well-put. We were accustomed to bringing chaos to foreign lands, but the combination of Covid and Trump brought the war home. We thought we were immune. Above it all. Exceptional. Why else would we have the chutzpah to elect a gross and obvious incompetent as president. We're lucky it was just Covid-19 and not Eboloa, we'd all be dead by now if that happened during Trump.  ",

The server reads the file on Metacritic, extracts the Facebook and Twitter metadata from the page, using the title in our database. I just want to be sure it's a real program, keep out the spam. I have some ideas for new UI's. But the main goal, as before, is to learn about worthwhile streaming programs. ",
