For a new user, one who has never logged onto LO2 before, there was a problem with the initialization code that creates your first outline. It's possible that you would get a blank screen instead of a new outline. Not a very good user experience. It should be fixed now. If you had previously tried to create an account and failed, it might be a good time to try again. If it works. please <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1266109713667821588\">let me know</a>. ",

And then the problem got even worse. As I was about to go out for my afternoon ride, my iPhone informed me that it had disabled Bluetooth for everything but my AppleWatch. No explanation of why it decided to do this. On my way out, with no music or podcasts to fill my mind, I thought how ridiculous it was that I had spent over $1000 on this device and I still don't own it. Apple says \"I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.\" They should change the name of the company to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE\">Hal</a>. ",
