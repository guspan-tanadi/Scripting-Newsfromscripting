On hearing of how awful the virus was, in January, he would have thought to himself, \"I just won re-election.\" How could that be you ask? Simple. He waits a bit until it's obvious to the press that it's an emergency then he gives a big Oval Office speech announcing the emergency and what we're going to do. It's exaclty what the CDC says to do. \"This is going to hurt,\" Trump reads off the teleprompter, \"but we'll get through it together.\" Then guess where his approval rating would be? 95%. Because that's how it works. We rally behind the leader in a time of crisis, even a douchebag like Trump. Who is more dumb than a sack of nails. I'm sure one of his advisors saw this as a political gift. All Trump had to do was listen. ",
