I had my <a href=\"http://my.bingeworthy.io/davewiner/\">own</a> recommendations ready to go, but I didn't have one for the whole community. You can help build BingeWorthy by helping spread the word about <a href=\"http://bingeworthy.io/tv/top/\">this page</a>. Thanks! :-)",

And you have a funny feeling the thing you just edited is going on the back of the card not on the inside. Who wants to spend the money and time only to find that you created an unusable thing. I have a lot of experience as a web designer, so I can handle crazy complexity, but these sites have all beaten me. Every one of them. ",
