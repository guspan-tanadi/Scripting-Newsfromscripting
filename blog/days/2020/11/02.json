Let's hope we can do better. Start by getting rid of the character limit in Twitter so we don't need to invent new channels just to distribute essays. Twitter can already do photos and video. People do all kinds of hacks to distribute writing. Let's re-legitimize it. Also can you imagine how pissed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Williams_(Internet_entrepreneur)\">Evan Williams</a>, Twitter co-founder and founder of <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a>, would feel if Twitter bought Substack? Leaving Medium out in the cold. It's long been assumed the reason Twitter didn't relax the character limit is because of Medium. As we say in the blogging world, oy. ",
