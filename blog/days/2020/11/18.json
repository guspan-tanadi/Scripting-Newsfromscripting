She says she didn't sign up for this, but that's the way it goes sometimes. She's being called on to save her country. This is about as must-read as anything I've ever seen.",

If we were playing chess with Trump, he hasn't knocked over his king yet, and he's right not to, given the rules he plays by, he still has a shot at winning. Losing as we know is a terrible <i>personal</i> outcome for him, not just the ego stuff, but practically speaking, he's been caught doing crimes that you go to jail for. Ask <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/7fa7f6d50c0aa6eae648a56b14065615\">Michael Cohen</a>. Most of us would accept the outcome, concede, show up for trial -- but not Trump. So even after the Electoral College votes, until he actually leaves the White House, it isn't over. ",

Why haven't there been any interviews? She has more power in this matter than any governor, or secretary of state, or McConnell even. Later it won't be so clear, once this situation has <a href=\"http://thesaurus.land/?word=fester\">festered</a>, but right now she alone has the power to turn the corner.
