For me, the function of an outliner is to let me record ideas and events to flow to different places over time. Flow is the big word. It's the <i>fluidity</i> of the outliner that makes the difference. I think of it as <a href=\"http://textonrails.com/\">text on rails</a>. Paper and whiteboards are not so flexible because of limited space. Outlines have unlimited space. I can always add a note and the software automatically makes room. And I can move something without erasing it (a weakness of paper). Fluidity. Are outlines linear? Not in any obvious way, to me at least. A linear tool would force everything to be on one line, at one level. The point of an outline is that you can go infinitely deep. The work has <i>structure.</i> A line is unstructured. ",

So maybe the idea of people inside and outside isn't serving us so well. I can't believe how long it takes our stupid political system to neutralize a <a href=\"http://this.how/trolls\">troll</a>. If journalism weren't so walled-off from those of us with our faces \"pressed against the glass\" we might have avoided a lot of the still-unknown <s>damage</s> carnage of the Trump years.
