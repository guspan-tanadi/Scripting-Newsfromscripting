It's the commercials on the telly, dummy. Happy families giving each other hugs and presents. And the virus! Commercials are engineered to perfection to make you think of doing the things in the commercials. They're selling the illusion of an idyllic holiday with love and friends. It may work next year, but this year it ain't love that's being transmitted at these gatherings. :rocket:",
