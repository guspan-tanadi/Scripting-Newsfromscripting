It seemed every presidency had one or two of these, but it was looking like we might not pay the big price for having a child-man with a bad temper in the White House. Well, it's almost hindsight now and worth observing that we did not get away with it. The pandemic is still building, could still explode, and Trump is still playing Pretend President. We're not out of the woods yet. ",

What's the purpose of such an expensive military beyond protecting Americans? ",
