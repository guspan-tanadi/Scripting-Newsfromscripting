The guy made the money, got paid for all the pixels. Anyway what made me think of this was President-elect Biden could sell seats at the virtual inauguration and use the money for a good cause.

Of course, not likely, given that more than half of NYC firefighters say they will <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/fdny-vaccine-covid-pfizer/8560168/\">refuse the vaccine</a>. These are people who run into burning buildings, but think the vaccine is too dangerous? ",
